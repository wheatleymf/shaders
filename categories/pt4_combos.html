        <b>What is a Combo?</b> In s&box shaders, it means a shader variant. If you're adding a new combo into your code, that does some extra 
        operations, this tells the compiler to create essentially a new variant of your shader. So inside your compiled shader with combos, 
        there's actually a collection of shader variants that switched between each other depending on features you're toggling 
        from the Material Editor.    
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt4_shadercombos.png">
    <p>
        Please note that this isn't how compiled shader code looks like. This image simplifies a lot of things to give you the general 
        idea of how combos are working internally. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>But why do I need combos? Can't I just use if-statements?</b> It all depends on what are you currently doing. There's nothing 
        wrong with if-statement if you're making a short value check in primitive, two-line maths, it will be okay. But if you're 
        making a huge if-statement block that branches entire code off to some big, expensive math, you will probably mess with the performance 
        even on very modern hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        So instead of branching off your code so hard and possibly adding issues to your shader performance, why not just use combos instead? 
        You still have a single shader file, and compiler generates all shader variants itself, which are static, and do not impact the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What's the difference between "static" and "dynamic"</b>? Functionally, they are the same, but both of them have unique 
        ways of interaction. <b>Static</b> combos can be toggled only from Material Editor, you can't interact with them from C#. <b>Dynamic</b>
        combos, on other hand, can be toggled from code but cannot be changed in Material Editor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Static combos</b> are useful for any extra visual features that you want to let artists toggle for their artwork, but don't want to keep 
        them always enabled in shader by default for performance reasons. <b>Dynamic combos</b> are good for anything that you want to 
        change at runtime via C#: for example, graphics settings, special features, or any other functonality that requires branching off your code.

    <h2>
        Creating a new static combo
    </h2>
    <p>
        Lets add a static combo to our shader. In last article we've added texture scrolling and tinting. Lets expand our texture tint 
        functionality by adding a new feature, which will allow tinting the texturing by a mask.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before adding a static combo, we must add a new feature inside the <string>FEATURES</string> block. This will initialize a new 
        feature property that will be visible in Material Editor. Go in that block, and above the <string>#include</string> line, add this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Feature( F_TINT_BY_MASK, 0..1, "Custom Features" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This is a special macro that creates a new material feature. Lets see what every argument in it means:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>F_TINT_BY_MASK</b> - this is a variable name. It'll be used both for a static combo, and for displaying the feature's 
                name in the material editor. It should always start with a <string>F_</string> prefix. (it'll be hidden in editor)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>0..1</b> is the range of available choices. 0 will mean "disabled", 1 is "enabled". You can define more than two choices, 
                but for now we just need "on/off".
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"Custom Features"</b> is the group name. Your feature will appear under this group in the material editor. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Position of stuff that appears in features list is sorted by depending on what was added in the code first. So by adding this feature 
        above the <string>#include</string>, it'll appear above all features added by core shader stuff. There is more functionality to features, 
        including ways to excluding features, adding rules and other fancy things. This page on <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/AnatomyOfVFX#features">s&box wiki explains</a> all available feature things quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've done it right, this feature will appear in the menu, but it won't do anything yet. We must now create a new static combo 
        and hook this feature's variable to it. Go to <string>PS</string> block, and under <string>#include "common/pixel.hlsl"</string>, 
        add the following line:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
StaticCombo( S_TINT_BY_MASK, F_TINT_BY_MASK, Sys( ALL ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now we have added a combo. Here's a short overview of the arguments you're typing there:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>S_TINT_BY_MASK</b> is the variable name of this static combo. It'll have the same value as <string>F_TINT_BY_MASK</string>.
                We can't use <string>F_TINT_BY_MASK</string> directly. We can use this variable for our special combo if-statements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>F_TINT_BY_MASK</b> is the feature's variable that is now attached to this combo. Your new static combo will grab the currently 
                selected value from this feature. You may want to give static combo the same name as your feature. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sys( ALL )</b> - this means on which system platform this combo is supported. For now you can use either <string>ALL</string>
                or <string>PC</string>, but it doesn't really do anything while s&box is available only on PC. I don't know if Facepunch still has 
                any plans on this property, but you must have it filled out anyway. ðŸ˜…  
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        When your combo is successfully added and connected to your new feature, we can add new optional code. First, lets add a new texture 
        input for the tint mask. And you'll also need change the way Texture2D object is created: instead of creating new Texture2D just for 
        the tint mask, we can put it into existing object instead. This is a nice and simple optimization, since material will generate just 
        one compiled texture instead of two, and we'll need to do sample just once instead of twice. Sampling can get expensive for rendering
        if you're doing it too often. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Under <string>TextureTint</string> declaration, add this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
#if ( S_TINT_BY_MASK )
    CreateInputTexture2D( TintMask, Linear, 8, "", "_tint", "My Material,10/20", Default( 1 ) );
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Unlike traditional if-statements, these ones have a slightly different syntax. Instead of brackets, they always start with 
        <string>#if ( CONDITION )</string> and end with <string>#endif</string>. Inside the macro, you're using <string>Linear</string>
        instead of sRGB like with a color map, because tint map is usually <b>grayscale</b>, which is represented by a single float vector,
        and we don't need to use sRGB color space for it. Also hence why it's "Default()" instead of "Default3()" now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That's not all. We need to re-arrange the placement of where Texture2D is created. First, cut (Ctrl+X) the line where you have 
        your <string>Texture2D</string> definition, and put it inside the combo statement, right after <string>CreateInputTexture2D()</string>.
        Then, inside the annotations, after the <string>Channel()</string>, add a new channel, set to <string>A</string>, box <string>TintMask</string>
        and color space <string>Linear</string>. Should end up looking like this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
#if ( S_TINT_BY_MASK )
    CreateInputTexture2D( TintMask, Linear, 8, "", "_tint", "My Material,10/20", Default( 1 ) );
    Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( AlbedoMap ), Srgb ); Channel( A, Box( TintMask ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Textures can use up to four channels, RGBA. Until then, A (alpha) channel wasn't used - now it is, by storing the tint mask into 
        texture's alpha channel. But hold on, now there's no Texture2D outside of this shader variant! How is it going to work? That's right, 
        it won't. We need to add <string>#else</string> with a separate Texture2D declaration without the alpha channel, which will be used 
        in a shader variant where static combo <string>S_TINT_BY_MASK</string> is disabled. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
#if ( S_TINT_BY_MASK )
    // This will be in a shader variant where S_TINT_BY_MASK is enabled
    CreateInputTexture2D( TintMask, Linear, 8, "", "_tint", "My Material,10/20", Default( 1 ) );
    Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( AlbedoMap ), Srgb ); Channel( A, Box( TintMask ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
#else
    // This will be in a shader variant where S_TINT_BY_MASK is disabled
    Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( AlbedoMap ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Good, now save the shader and see if it is working. Click on a freshly added custom feature, and see if anything happens.
        You should see a new texture input appear after enabling the <string>Tint By Mask</string> feature. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt4_feature.png">
    <p>
        If you try adding a mask, it will do nothing. There's bunch of changes you have to make inside <string>MainPs</string>. 
        First of all, currently it is sampling only RGB, since variable is a <string>float3</string>, and alpha channel isn't sampled.
        Second, current tinting method isn't accounting for a mask at all. Time to change this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Replace MyTexture's <string>float3</string> with <string>float4</string>. There's no point in wrapping this into a static combo, even if 
        given Texture2D doesn't have <string>A</string> component, it'll just return 0 without breaking anything. 
        Since we're sampling all 4 channels of this texture once, it means that alpha (tint mask) will inherit the UV scaling too.
        If you want it to have a different scale, you'll need to sample it separately. 
        Also remove <string>* TextureTint</string>, this part will be handled inside the combo branching.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
float4 MyTexture = g_tColor.Sample( g_sAniso, uv );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You also must update the returning value. Since this is a <string>float4</string> now, doing <string>float4( MyTexture, 1 )</string>
        won't work because MyTexture itself has four components now, and <string>1</string> will be considered as fifth one, which means compiler will fail. 
        In this case, you shouldn't return just the "MyTexture" variable itself because it's alpha component represents tint mask, not the opacity.
        Instead, do this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// We can specify which components of given vector need to be used.
// They can be selected in any order, and swizzled.
return float4( MyTexture.rgb, 1 );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now it's time to re-implement the way this texture is being tinted. Under the line where this texture is sampled, add this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
#if ( S_TINT_BY_MASK )
    MyTexture.rgb = lerp( MyTexture.rgb, MyTexture.rgb * TextureTint, MyTexture.a );
#else 
    MyTexture.rgb *= TextureTint;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        What's happening here: if given shader variant has <string>S_TINT_BY_MASK</string> enabled, then it will tint the texture 
        according to the tint mask (<string>MyTexture.a</string>). Texture masks are very useful for things like emission mask, 
        tint mask, opacity, and many other things - they're not really limited to any certain purpose, you're the one who decides 
        how to use a mask, and where. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt4_masks.png">
    <p>
        You can read about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-lerp">lerp function</a>
        here. It is a linear interpolation between two values, where third argument is the control value, expected in 0-1 range. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now as you can see, when you enable "Tint By Mask", you can throw any grayscale map in "Tint Mask" slot and it'll change the way 
        color texture is being tinted! Instead of changing colors everywhere, it applies tint only on corresponding parts of the mask.
    </p>

    <h3>Downsides of Combos</h3>
    <p>
        There's one important thing to note about static combos. While they're helpful with wrapping extra functionality and different
        rendering methods behind shader variants, it also increases the compilation time. While it won't be a problem if you have just 
        a few combos, adding too many features can compilation time hilariously long, due to a big amount of shader variants s&box 
        has to compile for you. So be aware what really needs to be wrapped behind a combo, and use <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/AnatomyOfVFX#example">feature rules</a>
        to exclude some features between each other, this will help with reducing amount of combos. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You must find a balance between features that need to be implemented through a shader combo, features that you can do through 
        default if-statements, and things that probably worth to be done in a separate shader altogether. Maybe, some features can be 
        included by default without having to make them optional. It's up to you. 
    </p>

    <h2>Dynamic Combos</h2>
    <p>
        Dynamic combos are used for enabling extra shader functionality at runtime, instead of manually toggling them through material 
        editor. Dynamic combos aren't connected to shader features, and cannot be adjusted through material editor. This is how you 
        declare them in PS block:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
DynamicCombo( D_OVERRIDE_COLOR, 0..1, Sys( ALL ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        They must start with a <string>D_</string> prefix. Second argument, just like with features, indicates how many options 
        this combo has. More options also means more shader variants. You don't have to add anything in <string>FEATURES</string> section, 
        this is the only thing you need to implement a new dynamic combo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside your code, dynamic combos are applied exactly the same way as with static combos. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To toggle dynamic combos, you must set the value for given combo through <string>RenderAttributes</string> in C# code. 
        It can be done either globally through scene, or by accessing attributes of specific GameObject's SceneModel. It feels like
        RenderAttributes deserve some attention, so I'll explain how to control dynamic combos in the next article.
