        Shaders allow manipulating vertices of your mesh in many ways. You can apply any sorts of math to vertex positions to 
        manipulate model's shape. Wind displacement, waves, many other things. Today I'll show some of the examples of how you can 
        move vertices around.  
    </p>

    <h2>Wind Displacement</h2>
    <p>
        First example will be <b>wind displacement</b>. This is an incredibly simplified simulation of how wind can displace the model, 
        but it should give a base idea how this technique generally works. To generate this sort of displacement, we'll need a 2D data 
        that represents the direction of vertices swaying around. You'll also need to use vertex colors to mark areas that should be 
        affected by wind. 
    </p>

    <h3>Setting up Vertex Colors</h3>
    <p>
        Most foliage shaders, like <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Foliage_Shader">built-in one</a>, uses vertex colors 
        to mark up mesh areas that must be affected by various types of wind sway. We'll do same thing in this case. Open Blender
        and your mesh, open vertex paint tools, set everything to black (shortcut <string>Ctrl+X</string>) and then paint with full red 
        color over the vertices that you want to make sway around. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt10_vertexpaint.png">
    <p>
        Then, as it was done in previous parts, export this mesh with vertex colors set in <b>Linear</b> color space and <b>Prioritize
        Current Color</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you're done, import this model into s&box and set up the model file for it using ModelDoc. Link the material that uses your 
        custom shader. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Effect Outline</h3>
    <p>
        You'll need some sort of data to represent the displacement, we can't just get these numbers out of nowhere. There are many ways to do it: 
        you can manually make a noise texture, or procedurally generate this noise yourself. We'll go with the second option, because it will give us 
        an opportunity to work with the built-in library of procedural data: noises, shapes and patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This library can be imported by adding <string>#include "procedural.hlsl"</string>. Since vertex displacement will be done in 
        vertex shader, this is where you should add this. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Outline:</b> You'll be using <string>Simplex2D</string> noise, which will be enough for this effect. Noise is generated based on the input value:
        in this case, it expects a 2D vector as an input. It could be an UV, but since this is done with vertices, you can just pass XY components 
        of vertices world-space position, stored in <string>o.vPositionWs</string>. We'll also multiply it by a seperate variable that will 
        define how strong this vertex displacement will be. 
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, noise isn't dynamic. To give it a moving effect, (which is what makes vertex displacement look like wind swaying around)
        it needs to be offset by a certain value - and time constant <string>g_flTime</string> is perfect for things like this. Just add it 
        to the noise value. To allow artists define how fast this "swaying" animation is, you can multiply time value by other number. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mapping this noise onto world-space coordinates without scaling will make it appear too small, probably.
        Just like with UVs for textures,  you can just multiply coordinates to make it appear larger for this Simplex2D noise. 
    </p>

    <h3>Vertex Shader Variables</h3>
    <p>
        Now, when the concept is outlined, let's code it. Start with adding variables for noise mapping scale, sway animation speed,
        and displacement intensity. This is being added in <string>VS</string> block, outside of <string>MainVs</string>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#include "common/vertex.hlsl"
#include "procedural.hlsl"

float g_flSwaySpeed < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 3 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup("Swaying Effect,1/Properties,1/10"); >;
float g_flNoiseScale < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0.1, 10 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Swaying Effect,1/Properties,1/20"); >;
float g_flDisplacementStrength < UiType( Slider ); Range( 1, 10 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Swaying Effect,1/Properties,1/30"); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will be enough to give artists enough control over how noise affects the vertices. Let's go into <string>MainVs</string>
        now and start doing more fun things.
    </p>

    <h3>World-space Vertex Position</h3>
    <p>
        First, make a new <string>float2</string> and copy XY components from <string>o.vPositionWs</string>. This will grab 
        world-space position of given vertex on X and Y axis. For wind-like displacement, using XY axis should be alright. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 vPosWs = o.vPositionWs.xy / (g_flNoiseScale * 50);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Dividing coordinates by <string>g_flNoiseScale</string> will increase their scale. This should increase the scale just enough 
        to make noise displacement appear pretty smooth. This variable is also multiplied by 50 to increase the "step" in scale.
        If you try removing this value and keep coords unchanged, you'll see that vertices are being displacement with a noticeable 
        grainy visuals, which may not fit your idea.  
    </p>

    <h3>Runtime Noise Value</h3>
    <p>
        Now, let's generate the noise value using the procedural noise library and <b>Simplex2D</b>. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float flNoise = Simplex2D( vPosWs + (g_flTime * g_flSwaySpeed) ) * g_flDisplacementStrength;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Simplex2D generates a noise using the coordinates from <string>vPosWs</string> vector, this is where you also add 
        time constant (multipled by speed value) to coords so it has an animated offset. The final noise is then multipled by intensity 
        variable to adjust how much it will displace the vertices.
    </p>

    <h3>Displacing Vertices</h3>
    <p>
        Now, update the original XY components of <string>o.vPositionWs</string> with the final noise value. Notice that it's being 
        multipled by <string>o.vVertexColor.r</string> - if given vertex has almost nothing painted on red component, which is close to 0,
        this will heavily reduce the intensity of displacement. So essentially, this prevents vertices from being displaced if you haven't 
        painted those vertices with red color on the mesh.  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
o.vPositionWs.xy += flNoise * o.vVertexColor.r;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You're almost done, but you also need to update <string>o.vPositionPs</string>, which is vertex position in <b>projection space</b>.
        It currently contains outdated values generated by <string>ProcessVertex</string> function, so you need to convert your modified world-space 
        coords into projection space yourself. This is easy: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
o.vPositionPs = Position3WsToPs( o.vPositionWs.xyz );
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Now set up the material and see how your vertices are being displaced!

    <h2>Vertex Snapping</h2>
    <p>
        Let's do some more specific effects! This one will replicate the effect from PSX games where low precision values resulted 
        in wobbly vertices on meshes. This has been done many times by many devs already, including <b>My Summer Cottage</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This time, no variables required: it's all just bunch of math. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Vertex Snapping by Small Fish (and ceitine)
// (c) 2022 ?..
float3 vPositionWs = o.vPositionWs.xyz;
float dist = distance(g_vCameraPositionWs, vPositionWs);

float scale = RemapValClamped( dist, 1000, 5000, 240, 800 );
float4 vertex = Position3WsToPs( vPositionWs.xyz );
vertex.xyz = vertex.xyz / vertex.w;
vertex.xy = floor( scale * vertex.xy ) / scale;
vertex.xyz *= vertex.w;

o.vPositionPs = vertex;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, all other global variables like camera position are still accessible! To calculate the distance between 
        vertex and camera positions, we're using built-in HLSL function <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-distance">distance()</a>.
        It will return the distance between these two vectors.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, we're using <b>RemapValClamped()</b>. It will remap the distance in a certain range with new minimum and maximum values.
        This is a built-in function from Source 2, which remaps the value in the range [A-B] to [C-D]. The implementation of this function looks something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Remap a value in the range [A,B] to [C,D]. Values < A map to C, and > B maps to D.
float RemapValClamped( float flOldVal, float flOldMin, float flOldMax, float flNewMin, float flNewMax )
{
    // Put the old val into 0-1 range based on the old min/max
    float flValNormalized = saturate( ( flOldVal - flOldMin ) / ( flOldMax - flOldMin ) );

    // Map 0-1 range into new min/max
    return ( flValNormalized * ( flNewMax - flNewMin ) ) + flNewMin;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Also, instead of adjusting world-space coordinates first, you can just directly edit projection-space vertices if you'd like. 
        This is also possible! Essentially, we're setting up vertex snapping to work on a certain distance, so it doesn't become too 
        annoyingly distorted at longer distances, which was a problem during early development of <b>My Summer Cottage</b>: props would 
        become stupidly wobbly in buildings.

    <h2>Sinusoid Waves</h2>
    <p>
        Simplest thing is this. It's probably weird that I am putting the simplest example at the very bottom of this article, huh. 
        Use the sin wave and XY components of vertex coords, and use it to distort vertices. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
o.vPositionWs.z += sin( (o.vPositionWs.xy / 50) + (g_flTime * 8) ) * 10;
o.vPositionPs = Position3WsToPs( o.vPositionWs.xyz );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will generate a very simple sin wave that distorts only the Z component of mesh vertices, so that could work 
        for water waves (although that would be a comically awful water sim) and maybe some other effects.
