        Shader attributes are also explained on <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/attributes-and-variables-UMUgpxSzA1">s&box documentation website</a>.
    </info>
    <p>
        <b>Render Attributes</b> allow passing any sorts of data from C# to your shader. It can be done either by passing the data 
        globally on scene, or passing it for individual GameObjects. This is also how you toggle dynamic combos, if you are using them 
        in your shader.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sbox.game/dev/api/Sandbox.RenderAttributes">RenderAttributes</a> is a class. It exists in <string>Scene</string>
        itself, and <string>SceneModel</string>. They are also utilized for screen post-processing components. If you want to make some of your 
        shader variables to be accessible through Render Attributes, you need to add a special annotation.
    </p>
    <info>
        Shader variables that are exposed as a render attribute won't be visible in Material Editor. You will be able to control them 
        only through C# code of your custom component. 
    </info>

    <h3>Adding attribute in shader</h3>
    <p>
        To show how do dynamic combos and attribute variables work, lets try overriding the final color through C# code. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Defining new attribute available for updating through C# code is very easy. You just have to make a new variable and give it a
        single annotation <string>< Attribute( "NameGoesHere" ); >;</string>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 OverrideColor < Attribute( "MyOverrideColor" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        If you'd like, you can also add an annotation <string>Default3()</string> (since this is a float3 variable) - this will allow the attribute 
        to fallback to a specific value instead of appearing black ( <string>float3(0, 0, 0)</string> ) when there's no data assigned to this property 
        from your C# code.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's no necessity to wrap this behind a dynamic combo, so it's going to exist in all shader variants. Now you should 
        update the code for the pixel we're returning in <string>MainPs</string>. Let's do something neat: instead of using 
        a bulky if-statement with our dynamic combo, you can just use a classic ternary operator instead. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
return float4( D_OVERRIDE_COLOR ? OverrideColor : MyTexture.rgb, 1 );
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        Please note that you won't be able to do this with combos if one of the variables inside this ternary (conditional) operator
        exists only in one of the shader variants.
        <br><br>
        For example, if you have a variable that exists only in code for a specific combo, and then you try to access it outside of this 
        combo block, your shader won't compile - because there will be one shader variant that has this combo code excluded, which means 
        this variable will not exist.  
    </info>
    <p>
        Now shader will return the color that you're passing from a custom C# component if dynamic combo <string>D_OVERRIDE_COLOR</string>
        is enabled. It's time to implement this C# component.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating a C# component for controlling attributes</h3>
    <info>
        I won't thoroughly explain the every bit of C# code here, I am expecting that you know how to do this already. I'm just showing 
        the basics how to interact with certain classes and methods to make them work with your custom shader.
    </info>
    <p>
        Generally, there are two primary ways to control render attributes of a surface shader. One of them is updating values 
        globally through scene, which will update all objects on your scene. Or grabbing GameObjects and update their attributes 
        through SceneObject individually.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To update the combo globally, grab scene's <string>RenderAttributes</string>
                by referencing <string>Scene.RenderAttributes</string>. Setting the value for combo is done using 
                <a href="https://sbox.game/dev/api/Sandbox.RenderAttributes/SetCombo">RenderAttributes.SetCombo</a>. 
                So <string>Scene.RenderAttributes.SetCombo( "D_SOME_RUNTIME_THING", 1 );</string> will set your dynamic combo to one, and this will
                be applied to every object with this material and shader on scene.
            </li>
            <li>
                To update the combo just for an individual object, you must access the GameObject's <string>SceneObject</string>
                component, where it contains <string>Attribute</string> component. 
                <string>(your SceneObject).Attributes.Set( "D_SOME_RUNTIME_THING", 1 )</string> will enable the combo just for selected object specifically.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Make a new component and give it any name you prefer. Inside of your new C# component, add to your class <string>: Component</string>
        and <string>Component.ExecuteInEditor</string>. It'll be easier to preview and mess with properties without going into play mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add a public property with <string>Color</string> type and bool property. And add a private variable for <string>ModelRenderer</string>
        component. Make an override for <string>OnEnable()</string>, you have to try grab the ModelRenderer component from this GameObject first. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
protected override void OnEnabled()
{
    // Try to fetch the ModelRenderer component from this GameObject, since this is where
    // we'll get the SceneModel.
    if ( GameObject.Components.TryGet< ModelRenderer >( out var renderer, FindMode.EverythingInSelf ) )
    {
        _modelRenderer = renderer;
    }
        else
    {
        Log.Error( "This GameObject is missing a ModelRenderer component. :(" );
        return;
    }

    base.OnEnabled();
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        On component start, it will try getting the ModelRenderer component of this GameObject. If it exists, it will be 
        stored in the local private variable called <string>_modelRenderer</string>. If it's missing, then we will return 
        with a sad error message.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now add an override for <string>OnEnabled()</string>. This is where you're going to constantly update the values for
        the current state of <string>D_OVERRIDE_COLOR</string> combo, and pass the override color. Check if <string>_modelRenderer</string>
        exists and if it's actually valid, and return if it isn't. You don't want NREs spamming your console every frame. And only after 
        this check update the combo and color value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
protected override void OnUpdate()
{
    if ( !_modelRenderer.IsValid() || _modelRenderer == null )
        return;
	
    // Get the SceneModel from ModelRenderer component
    var sceneModel = _modelRenderer.SceneObject;
		
    // Now update the dynamic combo and current override color with values of this component's properties
    sceneModel.Attributes.SetCombo( "D_OVERRIDE_COLOR", EnableOverride );
    sceneModel.Attributes.Set( "MyOverrideColor", OverrideColor );
	
    base.OnUpdate();
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Great! Now place a model on your scene that has material with your custom shader attached to it. Make sure it is actually 
        Model Renderer, not skinned variant. Then add newly created component. Try clicking on "Enable Override" checkbox and see 
        if anything happens. If you did it correctly, your material texture will be replaced with a solid color. :) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sbox.game/dev/api/Sandbox.RenderAttributes/Set">RenderAttributes.Set()</a> supports a big range of data types 
        that you can pass into a shader. If there's some type which structure fits HLSL data types, then it'll be likely supported by this method.
        It accepts vectors, integers, textures, buffers and matrices. Some special types like <string>Color</string> will be automatically 
        transformed into a vector-format, so in shader it'll be read as <string>float3</string> / <string>float4</string>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that you must be hyperaware of data types you're marking as an attribute in your shader code. If you, for example, 
        accidentally pass <string>Vector3</string> from C# to your shader as a <string>float2</string>, there will be no warnings or errors. 
        Shader will just read first two components and cull the 3rd one. If you see that your attribute data is rendering not as you expect 
    </p>

    <h3>Setting attributes through scene</h3>
    <p>
        If you duplicate your new GameObject with this color override component, and then try changing the color, you'll notice that it is applied 
        just for the current model. Which is probably what you want. But sometimes you want certain data/options passed globally, so it can be read 
        from every model that uses this shader. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Scene's render attributes are public and you can set any values to it anytime, and shaders will always have access to this data. 
        Just do <string>Scene.RenderAttributes</string> and then set any combo or values. It is extremely simple. Here's a snippet from 
        <b>Blocks and Bullets</b> code, where we use these attributes to update the graphics quality for a water shader without having to access it's model directly.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
var quality = SettingsManager.Settings?.WaterReflectionQuality ?? WaterReflectionQuality.Low;
if ( quality == WaterReflectionQuality.Disabled )
{
    Scene.RenderAttributes.Set( "D_REFLECTIONS", 0 );   // Do not render and sample reflection texture 
    Scene.RenderAttributes.Set( "WaterIterations", 8 ); // Amount of for-loops in shader, affects the water waves detail
    return;
}
