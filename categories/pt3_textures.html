    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Okay, I hope you didn't delete your new unlit shader yet, because we're going to use it for adding textures and variables.
        You'll learn how to use texture input macros, how do you display variables in Material Editor, and I'll show a few primitive tricks 
        to get more control over your visuals. We'll also get a bit nerdy about how sampling works and how exactly shaders knows where texture will be sampled.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Textures</h2>
    <p>
        Since currently you're still working on unlit shader, let's add just one texture for now. For this and future tutorials you'll probably
        need to get a PBR material texture set somewhere. You know, the basic PBR material, with albedo, normal, roughness, metalness and ambient occlusion maps.
        <b><a href="https://ambientcg.com/">AmbientCG</a></b> or <b><a href="https://cc0-textures.com/">CC0-Textures</a></b> comes with a bunch of 
        free materials you can use. But don't forget to check the licence! 
    </p>

    <h3>Disabling unnecessary texture inputs</h3>
    <p>
        You probably noticed that our new unlit shader has two random texture inputs that you didn't add. This happens when your 
        fragment shader code does not contain a special definition, <string>#define CUSTOM_MATERIAL_INPUTS</string>. This behavior is controlled 
        by one of the HLSL files you've imported in previous article. Without this definition, s&box will attempt to generate two default 
        texture inputs itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the <b>PS</b> block, right above the <string>#include "common/pixel.hlsl"</string>, add a new line with this text:
        <string>#define CUSTOM_MATERIAL_INPUTS</string>. After this, those two input slots will disappear, and we'll be able to define our own 
        inputs without random shit conflicting with our code. 
    </p>

    <h3>Texture2D Input macro</h3>
    <p>
        s&box uses a special macro to add a new texture input that'll be visible in Material Editor. s&box documentation has a good
        <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/attributes-and-variables-UMUgpxSzA1">page about it and other attributes</a>,
        which is a <string>CreateTexture2D( ... )</string>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Between <string>#include "common/pixel.hlsl"</string> and your <string>MainPs</string> code, lets add a texture input for a
        color map, or also known as albedo map. Albedo map just describes the color of a material's surface. That's enough for now.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateInputTexture2D( AlbedoMap, Srgb, 8, "", "_color", "My Material,10/10", Default3( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Ok, now lets decipher what every argument in this means if you haven't checked out the docs page yet... 

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>AlbedoMap</b> is a name of our input slot. It can be anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>sRGB</b> is a color space we choose for this texture. Generally, you may want to use sRGB for color maps like albedo,
                since it'll result in displaying texture colors the same way as you see them in other programs. For other maps that require 
                precision, like <i>normal map</i>, <i>ambient occlusion</i>, <i>roughness</i>, any other custom map, etc. you should use 
                <b>Linear</b> instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>8</b> means <i>8-bit depth</i>, or <i>precision</i>. Usually you don't need more than 8, unless you have a very specific case 
                like a normal map with 16-bit precision. (they're also heavier, keep this in mind)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>""</b> is supposed to be a compression format, but I'll be honest here, I don't know what the fuck is it doing here specifically. You probably should 
                leave it blank except for normal maps. If you're adding a slot for a normal map, you should type here <string>"NormalizeNormals"</string> instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>_color</b> is the expected file suffix. When you click on a search button in material editor, file explorer will automatically
                search for all files with the given suffix. Leaving it blank or incorrect won't break anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>My Material,10/10</b> is a UI group name and intended order of how it'll be displayed in Material Editor. "My Material" is the name of this group,
                first number is the order of this group, and second number is the order of this slot inside the UI group. There's a good 
                article on wiki explaining <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Shader_Reference#uigroup">more about UI groups and setting up the display order</a>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Default3( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 )</b> is the default color while this texture is unset. Set it to anything you'd like. 
            </li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Creating a Texture2D object</h3>
    <p>
        Very good, but so far we have only added the texture input, but we haven't created a <string>Texture2D</string> for it.
        Without this object we won't be able to reference the texture in main fragment shader function and sample it. Under this texture 
        input macro, add a new line: 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( Color ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Wow! We haven't seen <string> < ... >; </string> brackets before. What is this? What's this stuff inside? If I remember correctly, 
        these brackets and stuff inside it are called <b>annotation</b>. They're used when you're creating new Texture2D's, sampler states, and variable attributes.
        I think this isn't part of "clean" HLSL, but in my opinion they make your life a bit easier. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's look what's inside of this annotation, and what every thing in it means. It's very simple, lets start with <string>Channel( RGB, Box( AlbedoMap ), Srgb );</string>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>RGB</b> - selects which channels will be filled with contents of a selected texture input slot. Since we're creating a Texture2D
                for our albedo (color) map, which utilizes all three channels - red, green and blue - we're specifying RGB in this argument.
                For future reference, if you're adding a grayscale map like <i>Roughness Map</i> or <i>Ambient Occlusion</i>, it utilizes one channel,
                so you can select any channel for it. It's kind of like storing and swizzling float vector components! 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Box( AlbedoMap )</b> - select which texture input slot we should copy into our new Texture2D. Name inside this argument must 
                match the name of your texture input.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Srgb</b> - specifies the color space for this texture. As it's been mentioned above, for colors maps use <i>sRGB</i>,
                and for grayscale/normal maps use <i>Linear</i>.
            </li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next thing in here is <string>OutputFormat(BC7)</string>. This is where you select the <b>compression format</b> for your texture.
        Source 2 comes with a number of compression formats that you can choose, however for must cases <b>BC7</b> or <b>DXT5</b> will be enough.
        This page on s&box wiki explains really well <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Shaders/TextureFormats">available compression formats and use-cases</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last bit is <string>SrgbRead(true)</string>, which just signals that texture must be read in sRGB color space. Yeah, this is a third time 
        you're setting this texture to be read in sRGB mode... and I am not really sure if you're supposed to do it. 😅
    </p>
    <info>
        Textures and variables that aren't used anyhow inside the fragment shader will not show up in Material Editor.
        They must be anyhow used in the composition of a pixel we're returning to make them visible in editor. 
    </info>
    <p>
        Okay, now this texture is implemented. But it won't show up in Material Editor yet, because we aren't using it anyhow inside the fragment
        shader itself. Lets sample it, and make it appear on our material. Before we continue, lets check if your <b>PS</b> block is correct:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
PS
{   
    // Defining this keyword will get rid of any unnecessary input slots generated by s&box
    #define CUSTOM_MATERIAL_INPUTS
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"
    
    // Create a new 2D texture input slot with a name "AlbedoMap", read in sRGB color space,
    // with file suffix "_color", inside a UI group called "My Material" on 1st place, and default color 1,1,1 (white) 
    CreateInputTexture2D( AlbedoMap, Srgb, 8, "", "_color", "My Material,10/10", Default3( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ) );
    // Create a new Texture2D object, with RGB channels set to copy from input slot "AlbedoMap", with sRGB color space, 
    // compression format BC7, and uhh telling to read in sRGB format again. 
    Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( AlbedoMap ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;

    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
    {
        // Not using our new texture yet! Unused variables and textures won't
        // show up in the Material Editor.
        return float4( float3( 1, 0, 0 ), 1 );
    }
}     
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Also, you probably noticed this weird <b>g_t</b> in the texture name. Naming conventions in shaders can be quirky sometimes. For example,
        prefix <string>g_</string> just indicates that it's a <b>g</b>lobal variable. <string>t</string> indicates that this is a <b>t</b>exture.
        For some other stuff like float variables you can see things like <string>fl</string>, which just stands for <b>fl</b>oat. You aren't
        required to follow this naming format, stick with whatever feels easier for you.
    </p>
    <info>
        There's a cool thing about Material Editor: these little name indicators are automatically detected by the editor and hidden from 
        your UI. So stuff like <string>g_fl</string> is visible only for you in the source code, and for the compiler.
    </info>

    <h2>Sampling</h2>
    <p> 
        We need to sample our new texture inside fragment shader. This is where our data fron <string>PixelInput</string> will in come handy!
        Before that, lets take a very quick look on the <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/default-vertex-and-pixel-shader-inputs-WAuOKVmkZ5">structure</a> of <string>PixelInput</string> before we continue.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>float3 vPositionWithOffsetWs</string> - pixel position in world space, with offset. It uses three-component float vector which consists of XYZ coordinates.
                This isn't <i>real</i> position of a given pixel in the world.
            </li>    
            <li>
                <string>float3 vNormalWs</string> - geometric normals of your mesh
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float2 vTextureCoords</string> - <b>texture coordinates (aka UVs) of your mesh</b>. Model UVs are set up by artists 
                in any model editing program of their choice, this is an extremely common process, so I assume you're working with a mesh
                that has UV set up already.<br><br>

                Texture coordinates are set in 2D space, so it uses a float vector with two components. They're set in <b>[0-1]</b> range,
                but you can easily add or substract values to shift your textures, or multiply these coords to adjust the texture scale.<br><br>

                Each texture coordinate is defined by vertices, and then values are linearly interpolated between each other.
                This is what we will need to tell the shader where exactly we need to sample the texture. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float4 vVertexColor</string> - these are colors of each vertex. There are many good reasons to use them, like 
                setting up texture blend areas, tinting the texture by vertex color, defining various effects by vertex colors, etc.
                We don't need any of that for now, though.<br><br>

                Vertex colors can be defined via any model editing software, or via C#/s&box editor - tinting models in s&box using built-in 
                model renderer component will adjust vertex color values. In custom shaders this won't work out of the box, because 
                we need to add special data with appropriate semantic in the vertex input struct first. We won't do it for now, but keep this in mind. 
                <br><br>
                Vertex colors contain RGBA values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float3 vTangentUWs</string> & <string>float3 vTagentVWs</string> - geometry tangents that are calculated in vertex shader 
                using the helper function <string>ProcessVertex()</string>. They're used for transforming tangent space normals to world space,
                which we will need to do once we add shading model to our shader later. Of course, you can also use them for any other purposes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Texture2D.Sample() and SamplerState</h3>
    <p>
        That's a lot of information, sorry. Focus just on <string>vTextureCoords</string> for now. Inside the <string>MainPs</string> method,
        delete our previous code that returns a solid color, and create a new <string>float3</string> variable instead. Initialized it with 
        the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 MyTexture = g_tColor.Sample( g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords );        
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>.Sample()</string> is a special HLSL method that is available for Texture2D objects. First argument <string>g_sAniso</string>
        is a <b>sampler state</b>, which defines how this texture is interpolated. What is <b>g_sAniso</b> anyway?! This is one of the global 
        sampler states available in s&box. Unless you need a very specific sampler state, you can just use existing ones instead. 
        g_sAniso is a sampler state with <b>anisotropic</b> filtering, and <b>wrap</b> method on texture coordinates, which means 
        it'll stretch the texture to fit given texture coordinates. You can look up all <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/sampler-states-LlJc7ymJkq#h-common-samplers">available common sampler states here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it's been mentioned before, SamplerState supports various filter modes. <string>Point</string> filter would give your texture 
        pixelated visuals. If you want it, swap <string>g_sAniso</string> with <string>g_sPointWrap</string>. Or declare a new SamplerState 
        outside of the MainPs by doing <string>SamplerState pixels < Filter( Point ); >;</string>. What's the difference? Well, it's just easier
        to look at it yourself:
    </p>
    <img src="/media/samplingfilters.png">

    <h3>Sampling, and per-fragment data</h3>
    <p>
        Second argument is <string>i.vTextureCoords</string>. Using the PixelInput object <string>i</string> passed as an argument into 
        our fragment shader, we're accessing model's texture coordinates. But how does it even work? How does single variable contains 
        coordinates for every point of mesh?! Don't forget that data is <i>parallel</i>, every pixel on your screen will contain it's own set
        of data in <string>PixelInput</string>. Technically, that's called <i>per-fragment data</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By cycling over every pixel on your screen, shader is fetching the value of (for example) <string>i.vTextureCoords</string> for this pixel
        and uses this data for sampling the texture. Pixel #1 has values of <string>(0.0, 0.0)</string>, Pixel #2 has values of <string>(0.01, 0.02)</string>,
        and so on... As a result, we get a cohesive rendered image on your screen. It may be hard to understand, but once you're able to visualize 
        the process in your head, making shaders and various cool stuff gets much more easier. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/texcoords.png">
    <info>
        🤓☝️ Don't forget! X, Y, Z and W axis are equivalent to R, G, B and A components of a float vector. So on this image, X and Y axis 
        are visualized as a <u>red</u> and <u>green</u> color channels. Single color channel is represented by a single float value, which
        will be visualized as a grayscale color.
    </info>
    <p>
        Imagine that this cursor is the shader looking at this pixel on screen. Basically, it's checking which information this fragment (pixel)
        has. Using the struct, we find out that it has, for example, texture coordinates of <string>0.221, 0.583</string> value, position at
        <string>24.35, 439.1, 90.024</string>, and normals with <string>-1, -0.49, 0.33</string> values. (I've made them up just for example I'm 
        sorry if this sounds off)
    </p>
    <p>
        Using these values, shader starts sampling the texture, picking color at texture's position that are appropriate to PixelInput's 
        vTextureCoords. And eventually, this is how GPU draws a proper texture on screen. That's a very rough explanation just to give you an idea.
        Working with any other data works the same - you can grab any information from <string>PixelInput i</string> and use it to generate 
        any sort of color, normals, or other shit. With all needed information combined, this is how certain color is calculated, like lighting.  
    </p>
    
    <h3>Rendering the texture</h3>
    <p>
        I hope that info dump wasn't too confusing! Now it's time to render the texture on our screen. Return this texture using
        <string>return float4( MyTexture, 1 );</string>. Since our texture is only RGB with no transparency data included, we're forcing 
        our final pixel to keep opacity at 1. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt3_texturemat.png">
    <p>
        We can now see our new texture input in Material Editor. Add any image and it'll appear on our material. Beautiful. Now lets 
        give ourselves some control over this texture, shall we? Before that, make sure your fragment shader code code look like something this. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PS
{   
    // Defining this keyword will get rid of any unnecessary input slots generated by s&box
    #define CUSTOM_MATERIAL_INPUTS
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

        // Return a final pixel, with RGB values of our new texture, and forced opacity at 1. 
        return float4( MyTexture, 1 );
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Variable Attributes</h2>
    <p>
        We can define any kinds of variables that are visible in Material Editor. We can use this to have powerful control over the visuals 
        of our shader, minimize amount of hardcoded values, and if you're making a shader for your lovely artist in your team, you can give them 
        very fun tools to easily make his assets look awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for now lets add just some very basic things. For that, we don't need any macros, but we'll use annotations again. Just below our 
        Texture2D definition, lets add a new <string>float</string> property. We're going to use it to control texture scale. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Add a float variable that will control the scale of our texture on a mesh.
float TextureScale < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 5 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup("My Material,10/11"); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Let me point to this <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/attributes-and-variables-UMUgpxSzA1">s&box documentation page</a>
        on attributes once again, since it break downs pretty much everything you need to know. But lets review each property in this annotation anyway...

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>UiType( Slider )</b> - defines how this variable appears in UI, and how are you controlling it. For variables like this, 
                we have only Slider - which should be enough anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Range( 0, 5 )</b> - limits on available values for this variable. You can't set this variable to anything beyond this range.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Default( 1 )</b> - default value for this variable. It'll be automatically assigned when creating a new material. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>UiGroup("My Material,10/11")</b> - works the same way as for texture inputs. In this case, we're setting second value at 
                <string>11</string>, which means it'll appear right after the texture input slot.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, lets make our code a bit more flexible for changes. In future, we'll be sampling more than one texture in our shader. 
        Typing out <string>i.vTextureCoords</string> in every <string>.Sample()</string> is probably a bad practice if you intend to add 
        more control over the UVs, like right now. Instead, you can create a new <string>float2</string> variable, and reference texture coords in there.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 uv = i.vTextureCoords;
    </code></pre>    
    <p>
        Very nice. To adjust the scale of our texture, we just have to multiply it by our new float variable. Lets add it into the variable definition.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 uv = i.vTextureCoords * TextureScale;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now we can update <string>float3 MyTexture</string> sampling code by replacing <string>i.vTextureCoords</string> with 
        your new <string>uv</string> variable. So if we decide to add even more control for UVs and affect how texture is aligned,
        we'll need to update just one variable instead of editing every .Sample() in the fragment shader.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 MyTexture = g_tColor.Sample( g_sAniso, uv );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Your fragment shader code should look something like this now. 
    </p>    
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">

        Awesome!! So now when you go into the Material Editor, you'll see that we can control the texture scale. Increasing the variable 
        value will make our texture smaller, while moving slider down to zero will make our texture appear larger. 😮

    <h3>Texture Scrolling</h3>
    <p>
        Okay... As a last part of this tutorial, lets apply some really primitive maths, and work with some s&box global variables.
        This will be a good practice of using variable attributes too. We're going to add texture scrolling, where you can define 
        the direction of scroll on both axis individually, and adjust scroll speed. Buckle up! 
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to create two new variables with <string>float2</string> type. Set them up:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
int2 TextureScrollDirection < UiType( Slider ); Range2( -1, -1, 1, 1 ); Default2( 0, 0 ); UiGroup( "Texture Scroll,20/10" ); >;
float2 TextureScrollSpeed < UiType( Slider ); Range2( 0, 0, 4, 4 ); Default2( 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "Texture Scroll,20/20" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You'll need two variables: one of them defines the scrolling direction, and other defines the scrolling speed on each axis. 
        As you have noticed, first variable is set to limit values in <string>[-1 - 1]</string> range. This way we can set our texture 
        move not only towards positive X/Y axis, but also go into opposite direction. Why is it set to <string>int2</string> vector, why not 
        stick with float? You can replace it with a float2 vector, but this variable just defines the moving direction, actual intensity of 
        texture scrolling towards given direction can be set by adjusting the scroll speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scroll speed variable also uses <string>float2</string>. This way you can set scrolling speed for each axis. What about
        <string>Range2</string> and <string>Default2</string>, where did they come from? As for float components, depending on which type 
        of a float vector you're using, you'll need to use appropriate annotations for them. Since you are currently implementing a <string>float2</string>
        variable, for defining the range and default value you must add <string>2</string> to annotation's name. 3 for float3, 4 for float4. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First pair of arguments in <string>Range2</string> are the minimum value. Second pair is the maximum. So by setting it to <string>-1, -1, 1, 1</string>,
        you specify that given <string>float2</string> can't below <string>(-1, -1)</string>, and can't go higher than <string>(1, 1)</string>. 
        Minimum/maximum values can be non-uniform too, something like <string>Range2( -1, -2, 0.244, 4 )</string> would work just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, when you have these variables set up, time to hook up them into the code. Just under the line with your new <string>float2 uv</string>
        vector, you should append the global time variable, then multiply it by scrolling speed variable and scroll direction vector. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 uv = i.vTextureCoords * TextureScale;
uv += g_flTime * TextureScrollSpeed * TextureScrollDirection;       
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        By doing <string>uv +=</string>, you are using a <i>shorthand "add" operator</i> to <i>add</i> the current time value,
        which is corrected by given speed value, and direction vector to your UV variable. Okay, but <string>g_flTime</string>?! Where did that come from, what is this anyway?
    </p>

    <h3>Global Variables</h3>
    <p>
        s&box comes with a number of handy global variables that you can access anytime. There are at least three variables that you'll 
        probably use very often, it is <string>g_flTime</string>, <string>g_vCameraPositionWs</string>, and <string>g_vCameraDirWs</string>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>g_flTime</string> represents time. This value always goes up. This is what you can use to animate things in your shader.
                Multiplying this value can allow controling how fast things move. <string>g_flTime * 0.5</string> will make it 2x slower, and 
                doing <string>g_flTime * 2</string> will make it 2x faster. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>g_vCameraPositionWs</string> is a <b>float3</b> vector that represents world position of your current camera.
                It's always the position of your <i>main</i> camera, that currently renders everything. <b>Ws</b>
                in this name stands for "world space".
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>g_vCameraDirWs</string> is also a <b>float3</b> vector that represents the camera direction. It is often used for
                calculating effects like fresnel, which utilizes <i>normalized</i> camera direction in it's formula. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        There's plenty of others variables available. You can see a full list on <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Constant_Buffers#builtinconstantbuffer">s&box wiki</a>,
        (although be aware that some of the information there may be outdated), or <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/global-variables-kSdlbnBNq8">official s&box documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Back to our Shader</h3>
    <p>
        Now after the compiling, you'll see two new properties in the Material Editor. By default, direction vector is set to zero, which 
        means it won't go anywhere. Now try changing any of these values! Set the direction, try to speed up the scroll, or slow it down.
        Also, have you noticed that "Texture" is automatically cut from variable's display name?
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt3_scrolling.png">

    <h3>Color Variable, and Texture Tinting</h3>
    <p>
        We're almost done for now, just lets add one last thing. Lets add a <b>tint</b> variable, that we will use to adjust the color 
        of your texture. This will be very simple, add this below your definition of a <string>TextureScale</string> variable:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 TextureTint < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "My Material,10/12" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This time you're adding a variable with a <string>UiType</string> of <b>Color</b> instead of "Slider". This is extremely useful 
        when we need just to define a solid color. Since this isn't a slider, we don't need set up <string>Range3</string> either.
        Now move to the <string>MainPs</string> function, find the line where you're sampling the albedo map, and at the end of this 
        line multiply the texture by <string>TextureTint</string> variable:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 MyTexture = g_tColor.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ) * TextureTint;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now check the Material Editor. New property shows up, with a color picker UI. By default it is set to be a white color, 
        and you know that multiplying the value by 1 does nothing. Now change the color and see how your texture tints! 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt3_tint.png">
    <p>
        This isn't the only way how can you tint a texture. This approach can be applied with any other type of data, like 
        mesh vertex colors, texture maps, procedural noise, anything else really.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's it for now! Hopefully you've learned a few new things with this lengthy article. Next time, we're going to explore 
        static and dynamic combos: what's their purpose? How do we add new features to our shaders? Why do we need them?
