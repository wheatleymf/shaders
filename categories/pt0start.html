        This is the beginning of a <b>Shader Fundamentals</b> course. Before we start, it's important to note some stuff first.
        This course will be painfully obvious, and some things will be explained with unholy amount of detail - I am expecting that you 
        have nearly zero understanding of shaders. This is a very early iteration of this course, and some things may be incorrect, or poorly 
        written - please be patient as I try to polish this thing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll also mention one more time that this <a href="https://github.com/wheatleymf/shaders">this website is open on GitHub</a>.
        If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request and I'll review it. ðŸ™‚ (also feel free to bug me in Discord 
        if you do that, assuming that you're from s&box-related discord communities)
    </p>
    
    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>
        If you plan to continue learning shaders on your own, you must know where you can find references for s&box shaders. There's no Intellisense 
        so I highly recommend looking up existing code. 
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>s&box shaders location:</b> <string>Steam/steamapps/common/sbox/addons/base/assets/shaders</string></li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/shaders-oRSxPSL2n6">s&box Documentation on shaders</a>.
                This documentation covers lots of s&box shader API, helper functions and other useful things.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/AnatomyOfVFX">s&box wiki</a>. It isn't always up-to-date, but it never hurts to check it out.</li>
            <li>
                Microsoft also provides a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-language-syntax">complete documentation</a> for nearly everything what HLSL has. This probably won't be very useful for you as a beginner, but once you figure out the basics I recommend 
                visiting it for any specific things. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        I really encourage you to read source code for s&box shaders located in base addon, this may help figuring out some 
        confusing parts about shaders. Do not hesitate to mess with your code: try changing values, math, functions and see what 
        happens. Don't forget that you can visualize on screen nearly all data as colors. Don't be afraid to break shit, it's important 
        to understand how data is represented in shaders and what every function does. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Default lighting model that s&box uses relies on <b>PBR</b>, aka <b>Physically Based Rendering</b>. This means that you should probably be 
        familiar with default artist's PBR workflow, understanding why do you need such texture maps as albedo, roughness, normals, metalness, etc...
        This <a href="https://marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/">article on PBR by Marmoset staff</a> seems to be 
        pretty useful about the purpose of PBR and it's texture maps. 
        And if you'd like to get extremely nerdy about it and understand the math behind it, <b><a href="https://pbr-book.org/">"PBR Book"</a></b>
        should be very helpful for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        And another tip: take your time. If something isn't clicking in your head and you can't figure out some concept, try again later.
        Learning new things can fuck with your sanity sometimes, and sometimes the best solution is just "get some rest and come back to this later".
    </p>

    <h3>Do I need to understand programming?</h3>
    <p>
        Yeah. HLSL isn't a good language to start your programming adventures. If you have some experience with C#, you should feel comfortable 
        with 99% of HLSL syntax. Just like most other languages, is is made of variables, classes, functions and statements. 
        You can define custom functions and classes, and do any sorts of math.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're an artist looking to learn shaders and you have no programming experience, I highly recommend mess with C# first 
        and then come back to this later. It is possible to learn HLSL without prior knowledge, but I imagine that it will be
        quite painful... but I am not going to stop you. 
    </p>

    <h3>Software Recommendations?</h3>
    <p>
        It doesn't really matter, so pick any text editor you prefer. Some people use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>, some prefer to
        work in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. Stuff like <b>JetBrains Rider</b> probably also works.
        If you're using VS Code, there are bunch of extensions that can improve HLSL code markdown to make navigating through code much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you decide to pick Visual Studio Code, I believe it will automatically recognize s&box shaders in ShaderLab format. This will 
        properly highlight most of the code, although there will be some inaccuracies. 
    </p>

    <h3>IntelliSense</h3>
    <p>
        As of now, there's no IntelliSense for HLSL code or s&box API. This may appear annoying at first, but there's a good thing about
        s&box API - it doesn't rely on internal functions and API <i>too much</i>. You won't need to remember hundreds of random macros, 
        functions, or anything else. With enough practice, you'll feel comfortable typing code without having to constantly look up docs 
        or some reference shaders, as long as you remember the HLSL syntax.
