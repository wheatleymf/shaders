        This is the beginning of a <b>Shader Fundamentals</b> course. Before we start, it's important to note some stuff first.
        This course will be painfully obvious, and some things will be explained with unholy amount of detail - I am expecting that you 
        have nearly zero understanding of shaders. This is a very early iteration of this course, and some things may be incorrect, or poorly 
        written - please be patient as I try to polish this thing. 
    </p>
    <h2>References</h2>
    <p>
        If you plan to continue learning shaders on your own, you must know where you can find references for s&box shaders. There's no Intellisense 
        so I highly recommend looking up existing code. 
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>s&box shaders location:</b> <string>Steam/steamapps/common/sbox/addons/base/assets/shaders</string></li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/shaders-oRSxPSL2n6">s&box Documentation on shaders</a>.
                This documentation covers lots of s&box shader API, helper functions and other useful things.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/AnatomyOfVFX">s&box wiki</a>. It isn't always up-to-date, but it never hurts to check it out.</li>
        </ul>

        You probably already know about websites like <b>The Book of Shaders</b> or <b>Shadertoy</b> so I won't suggest them here. 
        Microsoft also provides a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-language-syntax">complete documentation</a> for nearly everything what HLSL has. This probably won't be very useful for you as a beginner, but once you figure out the basics I recommend 
        visiting it for any specific things. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Default lighting model that s&box uses relies on <b>PBR</b>, aka <b>Physically Based Rendering</b>. This means that you should probably be 
        familiar with default artist's PBR workflow, understanding why do you need such texture maps as albedo, roughness, normals, metalness, etc...
        If you'd like to get extremely nerdy about it, <b><a href="https://pbr-book.org/">"PBR Book"</a></b> should be very helpful. 
    </p>
    <p>
        And another tip: take your time. If something isn't clicking in your head and you can't figure out some concept, try again later.
        Learning new things can fuck with your sanity, and sometimes the best solution is just coming back to it later.

    <h2>Do I need to understand programming?</h2>
    <p>
        Yeah. HLSL isn't a good language to start your programming adventures. If you have some experience with C#, you should feel comfortable 
        with 99% of HLSL syntax. Just like most other languages, is is made of variables, classes, functions and statements. 
        You can define custom functions and classes, do any sorts of maths using same operators
    </p>
    <h2>Software Recommendations?</h2>
    <p>
        It doesn't really matter, so pick any text editor you prefer. Some people use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>, some prefer to
        work in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. Stuff like <b>JetBrains Rider</b> probably also works.
        If you're using VS Code, there are bunch of extensions that can improve HLSL code markdown to make navigating through code much easier.
    </p>
    <h2>IntelliSense</h2>
    <p>
        As of now, there's no IntelliSense for HLSL code or s&box API. This may appear annoying at first, but there's a good thing about
        s&box API - it doesn't rely on internal functions and API <i>too much</i>. You won't need to remember hundreds of random macros, 
        functions, or anything else. With enough practice, you'll feel comfortable typing code without having to constantly look up docs 
        or some reference shaders.
