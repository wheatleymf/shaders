            <b>IN THIS ARTICLE: </b> making a primitive skybox shader. 
        </i>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Let's make a simple custom skybox shader. Goal for this will be adding very simple sky color, clouds, and bunch of 
        other little details. 
    </p>

    <h2>Shader Setup</h2>
    <p>
        You can prepare shader structure in the same way as any other shader. Most important part of skybox shaders is to 
        correctly set up vertices positions so they're aligned to your camera correctly. You can still use PixelInput/VertexInput 
        structs, although this is optional and you can make your own structs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How do I use the shader?</b> Make a new material in s&box editor, assign your skybox shader to it. It's okay 
        if your shader doesn't have any properties exposed for the material editor. After that, you can put this material 
        into the <b>2D Skybox</b> component. 
    </p>

    <h2>Vertex Shader</h2>
    <p>
        Let's start with setting up the vertex shader. Unlike generic surface shaders, we need to configure vertex position 
        in a different way. 2D skybox is always rendered behind everything on scene because, well, this is a skybox. 
        Here's a code snippet: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
{
    PixelInput o;

    o.vPositionWs = i.vPositionOs;
    o.vPositionWs = g_vCameraPositionWs.xyz + i.vPositionOs * 100;
    o.vPositionPs = Position3WsToPs( vPositionWs. );
            
    return o;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        First, we don't do <string>ProcessVertex()</string> or <string>FinalizeVertex()</string>, we don't need any of this 
        and we're going to return the vertex as is. Instead of ProcessVertex, we're creating a new PixelInput directly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, we copy object-space vertex position (<string>vPositionOs</string>) into world-space position slot
        (<string>vPositionWs</string>). Object-space position coordinates are relative to the base mesh itself, this is how 
        vertices are aligned in every mesh. In our case, this is what we need for the skybox. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Second part is updating <string>vPositionWs</string> again, but this time we're adding current camera position to 
        object-space coordinates, which makes vertices to stay fixed near our camera. Current position wouldn't be enough 
        to render correctly though.
    </p>
    <p>
        To fix that, "increase" the size of a skybox by 100. (<string>i.vPositionOs * 100</string>) This will avoid any 
        potential glitches, like skybox "bleeding" with high FOV camera, or rendering incorrectly in your env probes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At last, don't forget to update <string>vPositionPs</string> by converting world-space vertex position to 
        projection space, which will make them aligned on your screen correctly. Without this step, any changes to vertices 
        in <string>vPositionWs</string> won't have any effect. 
    </p>

    <h2>Pixel Shader</h2>
    <p>
        You can now move onto the main part, the pixel shader. As I said, I won't get too deep into details and provide a nice
        skybox example. s&box has a built-in shader called <string>atmospheric_sky.fxc</string> that comes with a complex, 
        and very nice looking procedural sky that supports both day & night lighting. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Right before <b>MainPs</b> section, disable backface culling using this render state:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
RenderState( CullMode, NONE );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will force the shader to never cull backfaces. If this render state is enabled, skybox shader won't render 
        at all.
    </p>

    <h3>Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
        First, we need to get the correct coordinates that we'll be using for sampling everything. 
        We won't be using traditional UV vector, instead you will use view ray vector:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 vPositionWs = i.vPositionWithOffsetWs + g_vCameraPositionWs;
float3 vRay = normalize( vPositionWs - g_vCameraPositionWs );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        I don't know if you really need this, but there's also a built-in Valve function called 
        <string>CalculateCameraToPositionDirWs( vPositionWs )</string>, which will return you an identical view ray vector. 
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Sky Color</h3>
    <p>
        Create two color inputs for the material editor. One will represent upper part of the sky, and other will be sky horizon.
        They must be a <string>float3</string> vector:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Material properties
float3 SkyColor < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "Sky, 10/10" ); >;
float3 SkyHorizon < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 0, 1 ); UiGroup( "Sky, 10/20" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        And now just lerp between these two colors, then return it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 sky = lerp( SkyHorizon, SkyColor, saturate( vRay.z * 2 ) );
return float4( sky, 1 );
    </code></pre>

    <img src="/media/pt14_gradient.png">

    <p>
        Don't forget that view ray vector is normalized, meaning that it's in <string>-1 to 1</string> range.
        Without saturating this value, (clamping it to <string>0 to 1</string>) it will result in glitchy lerp.  
        I am multiplying <string>vRay.z</string> by 2 to make the transition between two colors sharper. You can get 
        rid of this part, or change the value, and see how this affects the gradient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why Z component? Because this is what represents the Z axis of the skybox, obviously. It starts at 1, which is top part 
        of the skybox, and -1 is the bottom. 
    </p>

    <h3>Sun</h3>
    <p>
        Let's draw sun on the sky! For that, we are going to use great light API which allow us to easily loop through 
        lights available on screen. This means that you don't need to bother about copying any data from CPU to your shader 
        using render attributes. Everything you do will be done inside this shader, no extra setup. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Right after creating your sky color variable and lerping two colors, create a new loop. We will loop through each 
        available light source, and <string>Light::Count( i.vPositionSs.xy )</string> will tell you how many of them 
        is available on screen. Use this value as a condition for loop break. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Light::Count will tell you how many lights is available 
for ( int j = 0; j < Light::Count( i.vPositionSs.xy ); j++ )
{
    ...
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Inside the loop, create a new <string>Light</string> object, this is where you will copy light data for current loop 
        iteration. This is done using <string>Light::From( vPositionSs, vPositionWs, id )</string>. <b>vPositionWs</b> is 
        world-space pixel position, <b>vPositionSs</b> is screen position, and <b>id</b> is your current loop iteration,
        in this case it's <string>j</string>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
for ( int j = 0; j < Light::Count( i.vPositionSs.xy ); j++ )
{
    // Copy the light object 
    Light light = Light::From( i.vPositionSs.xy, vPositionWs, j ); 
} 
    </code></pre>    
    </p>
    <p>
        Next step will be checking if current light is <b>directional</b>, aka sun. We don't want to draw irrelevant light sources obviously, 
        like every point/spot light. But how do you do that? According to <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/light-2kZG4rs3k1">Light API docs</a>,
        position value for directional lights is identical to <b>Direction</b>. Let's use this knowledge to quit loop early if light object 
        doesn't match this condition. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
for ( int j = 0; j < Light::Count( i.vPositionSs.xy ); j++ )
{
    // Copy the light object 
    Light light = Light::From( i.vPositionSs.xy, vPositionWs, j ); 

    // Quit early if light position isn't equal to direction 
    if ( distance( light.Position, light.Direction ) <= 1 ) 
        continue;
} 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        At last, let's draw the sun. For this bit, I'm taking the code from <string>atmospheric_sky</string> shader. 
        Get a dot product between view ray direction, and sun's direction. Use <string>pow</string> to make the sun radius 
        much smaller. Multiply it by <b>10</b> to slightly increase the radius and make the borders a little sharper.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float fSun = pow( saturate( dot( vRay, light.Direction ) ), 10000 ) * 10;
sky += light.Color * fSun * 5;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You can edit these values as you wish to adjust sun radius, border sharpness, and any other properties, these aren't 
        magic values and you can do whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last bit is adding light's color to sky. <string>fSun</string> is used as a mask here. It is multiplied by <b>5</b>
        to increase the color intensity, sun is very bright after all. 
    </p>

    <img src="/media/pt14_sun.png" >

    <p>
        Now it's done! Sun now shows up in the sky. If you'd like to go even further, you can make sun fade as it reaches the horizon.
        For that, multiply the <string>fSun</string> mask by view ray's Z component, and don't forget to saturate it beforehand. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
fSun *= saturate( vRay.z );
    </code></pre>

    <img src="/media/pt14_sunhorizon.png" >

    <p>
        Now, sun will fade after reaching the horizon line. Very nice! Since now you can access sun's direction, you can write 
        your own sky atmosphere code and do anything. Sun direction vector is all what you need to determine if it's morning, day, evening, or night.
        I won't be doing this for this article, but feel free to check out 
        <string>atmosphere_sky</string> code. This is how code looks so far:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
{
    float3 vPositionWs = i.vPositionWithOffsetWs + g_vCameraPositionWs;
    float3 vRay = normalize( vPositionWs - g_vCameraPositionWs );
    float3 vCamDir = g_vCameraDirWs;
		
    // Draw basic sky + horizon colors using the Z component of view ray vector
    float3 sky = lerp( SkyHorizon, SkyColor, saturate( vRay.z * 2 ) );

    // Loop through all available light sources using light API, skip all lights
    // that aren't directional. 
    for ( int j = 0; j < Light::Count( i.vPositionSs.xy ); j++ )
    {
        Light light = Light::From( i.vPositionSs.xy, vPositionWs, j ); 
        
        // Early exit if current light isn't directional
        // Directional lights have identical position & direction. 
        if ( distance( light.Position, light.Direction ) <= 1 ) 
            continue;

        // Create a sun mask 
        float fSun = pow( saturate( dot( vRay, light.Direction ) ), 10000 ) * 20;
        
        // Clip sun mask entirely if it reaches the horizon level
        fSun *= saturate( vRay.z * 100 );
        sky += light.Color * fSun * 5; // multiply by 5 for stronger light intensity
    }

    return float4( sky, 1 );
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Texture Cubes (extra)</h3>
    <p>
        This is an optional step, but if you want to render images on skybox, this is possible, too. For that, you will need 
        a <b>TextureCube</b> texture. Unlike Texture2D, this one has a different sampling method, and it exists for things 
        like cubemap reflections, skybox UVs, and other things too!
    </p>
    <p>
        Add an input slot for material editor. This will look a bit different than usual:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateInputTextureCube( SkyTexture, Srgb, 8, "", "_color", "Sky, 20/30", Default3( 1, 1, 1 ) );
TextureCube g_tSkyTexture < Channel( RGB, Box( SkyTexture ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Instead of <string>Texture2D</string>, it's TextureCube. Syntax inside this macro is still the same. Instead of creating 
        a new Texture2D, you'll be creating a <string>TextureCube</string>, where attribute syntax is also identical. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <string>TextureCube</string> requires a <string>float3</string> UV for sampling. In this case, <b>view ray</b> vector 
        is exactly what you need. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 CubeSky = g_tSkyTexture.Sample( g_sAniso, vRay );
// Add, multiply or do whatever you want with the texture 
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        For skybox textures, it's recommended to use resolutions in 2K-4k range. Lower size textures will look worse. 
    </info>

    <img src="/media/pt14_texturecube.png" >

    <p>
        If you want to add more little detail to cube textures, you can <b>rotate</b> this view ray vector. For this, I am going 
        to use <string>AngleAxis3x3</string> function by <b>keijiro</b>, you can find <a href="https://gist.github.com/keijiro/ee439d5e7388f3aafc5296005c8c3f33">the gist here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add this function somewhere before <string>MainPs</string>:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3x3 AngleAxis3x3( float angle, float3 axis )
{
    float c, s;
    sincos( angle, s, c );

    float t = 1 - c;
    float x = axis.x;
    float y = axis.y;
    float z = axis.z;

    return float3x3(
        t * x * x + c,      t * x * y - s * z,  t * x * z + s * y,
        t * x * y + s * z,  t * y * y + c,      t * y * z - s * x,
        t * x * z - s * y,  t * y * z + s * x,  t * z * z + c
    );
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>angle</string> is the angle of rotation in radians, and <string>axis</string> is a vector that indicates
        which axis you want to rotate. As a result, it returns a rotation matrix.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Before sampling the texture, do this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3x3 mAxisRotation = AngleAxis3x3( g_flTime * 0.05, float3( 0, 0, 1 ) ); 
float3 vRayRotation = mul( vRay, mAxisRotation );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        We're going to use time variable (extremely slowed down) as a rotation angle value, so it stays animated, 
        and for the axis I'm creating a new float3 vector, where Z component is the only non-zero value, so it means that 
        vector rotation will be performed only on Z-axis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After new matrix is created, multiply your original view ray vector and matrix using HLSL function called 
        <string>mul()</string>. Once this is done, sample your cube texture using <string>vRayRotation</string>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 CubeSky = g_tSkyTexture.Sample( g_sAniso, vRayRotation );
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Clouds</h3>
    <p>
        This is going to look ugly as hell, but I just want to show you an example how can it be done. For this example, 
        I'm going to use a built-in noise function, but you can also draw by sampling a texture, too. Don't forget to add 
        <string>#include "procedural.hlsl"</string> in your PS section if you're going to follow this section. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Coordinates for noise/texture sampling is this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 vCloudUv = vRay.xy / abs( vRay.z );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now let's sample Simplex2D noise using these coordinates. As I said, these UVs will also work for texture sampling.
        I really, really recommend using textures for clouds, since noises (especially in multiple passes) aren't ideal for performance. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Simplex2D is in [-1 to 1] range, so we need to remap it to avoid glitchy visuals. 
float2 vCloudUv = vRay.xy / abs( vRay.z );
float cloud = Simplex2D( vCloudUv - g_flTime * 0.1 ) * 0.5 + 0.5;
    </code></pre>

    <img src="/media/pt14_clouds_shit.png" >

    <p>
        You can directly add it to sky color and see the result. Wow, it is rendering twice, even below the horizon! This isn't 
        what we want, but luckily there's an easy solution: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
cloud *= saturate( vRay.z * 0.5 ); 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Multiplying cloud by view ray's Z component will completely remove clouds from appearing under the horizon.
        View ray is multiplied by 0.5 just to make clouds appear slightly darker, otherwise they'll glow like crazy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like with any other UVs, you can manipulate it to adjust scaling, movement animations, and distortions. I'll leave 
        this up to you. 
    </p>

    <img src="/media/pt14_clouds.png" >

    <h3>Fog</h3>
    <p>
        Don't forget to add support for fog! Usually it's done as a part of the shading model, but since we return the skybox 
        color directly, you need to add fog yourself. Don't worry, it's done with the <string>Fog</string> class.
        Just add this at the bottom of your code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Function implementation: 
// Fog::Apply( float3 vPositionWs, float2 vPositionSs, float3 color )
sky = Fog::Apply( Depth::GetWorldPosition( i.vPositionSs.xy ), i.vPositionSs.xy, sky );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>Fog::Apply()</string> will apply the entire stack of atmospherics supported by s&box, which is gradient fog, 
        cubemap fog, and volumetric fog. The only problem here is cubemap fog, which doesn't work with custom skybox shaders 
        unfortunately. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why am I using depth here?</b> Usually Fog class takes world-space pixel position, and we do have <string>vPositionWs</string>
        here, but it is not going to be correct in this situation, because it holds object-space vertex coordinates, adjusted
        by camera position. <b>Depth::GetWorldPosition</b> fills the gap, and returns exact coordinates. This is an unique case,
        and in regular surface shaders you should keep using <b>vPositionWs</b> for fog class. 
    </p>

    <img src="/media/pt14_fog.png" >

    <p>
        That's all for now! As I said, this looks like shit, but I just wanted to show you the base idea how to set up 
        the shader, draw things, and apply s&box atmospherics.
