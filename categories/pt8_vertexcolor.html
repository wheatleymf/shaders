        Vertex color is a pretty old feature that existed in engines for a long time. This is a very easy way to encode any sorts of data 
        that you can read from shaders, which can be used for any purposes. Almost all engines support reading color data from vertices, 
        and almost all 3D editing software supports painting vertex colors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Vertex colors are often used for texture blending: blending shader reads vertex color channels and applies corresponding material layer. 
        This is how texture blending works in Hammer, and this is how texture blending is implemented for Rust props. Other popular use-case 
        is foliage: <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Foliage_Shader">this wiki page about Foliage Shader</a> shows how vertex colors 
        are used to determine what kind of "foliage swaying" should be applied onto certain parts of the mesh.   
    </p>

    <h2>Applying Vertex Colors in Blender</h2>
    <info>
        This section currently covers only Blender. If anybody else is familiar with how is it done in other editing software,
        please feel free to let me know and I'll feature it here. :P 
    </info>
    <p>
        Create a new file and build any kind of geometry you'd like. You can stick with a default cube, too. In the toolbar above, 
        where you can switch current editing mode, select <b>Vertex Paint</b> - new UI will show up with tools to select color and brush 
        type. Paint any kind of color. 
    </p>

    <p>
        When you're done, export this mesh as a FBX file. In export settings, don't forget to export only <b>mesh</b> (including 
        Blender's default light and camera will add up unnecessary size to your FBX file). In <b>Geometry</b> tab, set "Vertex Colors"
        property to Linear, and click on <b>Prioritize Active Color</b>. This should correctly export your mesh with vertex colors. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt8_meshexport.png">
    <p>
        Throw this FBX file in your s&box project. Now, we need to set up reading vertex colors in your shader. This is very easy!
    </p>

    <h2>Implementing Vertex Colors in Shader</h2>
    <p>
        First, you need to extend <b>VertexInput</b> by adding a new property that is linked to COLOR semantic. This is how it'll look like:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
struct VertexInput
{
    #include "common/vertexinput.hlsl"
    float4 vColor : COLOR0 < Semantic( Color ); >;
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then, go to <string>VS</string> section. PixelInput already comes with a property for vertex colors, but you'll need to manually 
        store data in it before it can be used in the fragment shader:  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
{
    PixelInput o = ProcessVertex( i );
        
    o.vVertexColor.rgb = i.vColor.rgb;

    return FinalizeVertex( o );
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Since <string>o</string> is a PixelInput object that vertex shader will return as a result, you can access it's <string>vVertexColor</string>
        property to store vertex colors read from unprocessed <string>VertexInput</string> data. Now it will available from fragment shader.
    </p>
    <info>
        Sometimes, depending on your mesh export settings, colors may differ from what they looked like in your 3D editor. At least in Blender,
        you can switch between <b>linear</b> and <b>sRGB</b> color spaces for vertex colors. 
        <br><br>
        In our case, vertex colors are exported in linear colorspace already, so you simply copy the property into another struct. But 
        this will be incorrect if your mesh comes with vertex colors in <b>sRGB</b>. 
        <br><br>
        If that's the case, before storing data into <string>vVertexColor</string>, you should convert them from sRGB to linear using helper
        function <string>SrgbGammaToLinear( i.vColor.rgb )</string> first.    
    </info>

    <h2>Previewing Vertex Color</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to know if this actually works, you can temporarily override <string>ShadingModelStandard::Shade</string> and replace it 
        with something like <string>return float4( i.vVertexColor.rgb, 1 );</string>. If you want to keep preview as a nicer feature, you can 
        probably wrap it as another static combo, or exposed boolean in material editor.  
    </p>

    <h2>Affecting Vertex Colors from C#</h2>
    <p>
        Technically, you can adjust vertex colors from C# by applying tint to your model renderer. Under the hood, it just writes to 
        shader's vertex color property. This will set all vertices on your mesh to appear as a certain color, but stuff like this can also 
        be utilized for various effects. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Deathcard by Small Fish uses tint to adjust player's opacity when camera gets too close to the character. It tints 
        alpha channel which adjust character's opacity. Also, when painting textures in Hammer, it also just writes specific vertex color 
        to the world geometry, this is how <string>blendable.shader</string> is set up.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next article, I'll show how to add simple blending to your mesh, and utilize world-space normals as a little fun effect.
