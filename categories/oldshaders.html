    <p>
        s&box is almost 4 years old. Shaders API have changed a lot since then. If you've done some research on shaders and tried
        to find something useful in s&box discord, you probably noticed that older messages have mentions of various API things 
        that are no longer used. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're backporting an old shader and making it compatible with modern s&box, this article should help with converting 
        some old bits into modern API.
    </p>

    <h2>Dynamic Expressions</h2>
    <p>
        Since <b>October 2025</b>, dynamic expressions are no longer suppored in s&box. They allowed people to implement custom rendering 
        logic into existing shaders. Facepunch finds this implementation not ideal, and wants to provide something better in the future
        along with a new material editor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you had materials that depend on dynamic expressions to override how some things are rendering in shaders you didn't make, 
        (compiled shaders from cloud/other games with no access to the source code) you will likely need to make a new shader to 
        re-implement the functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Expressions were also used by shader themselves, specifically for evaluating some variable/attribute data before it even 
        reaches the execution block (vertex/pixel/compute shader, etc..). They also allowed reading the values from features
        without using static combos: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
FEATURES 
{
    Feature( F_SOME_COOL_THING, 0..1, "Special Features" );
}

...

PS
{
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

    // Read the value from "Some Cool Thing" feature 
    int FeatureValue < Expression( F_SOME_COOL_THING ); >; 
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        In some cases it was pretty useful, because it allowed adding some bonus functionality that could be controlled from the 
        features UI in the material editor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is no longer possible, since <string>Expression</string> attribute was removed too. If you had any shader that relied 
        on this kind of functionality, there's only one workaround that I can possible think of: moving the variable to material 
        material editor UI as a checkbox, or int slider:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PS
{
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

    // Re-implement the variable as a checkbox 
    bool FeatureValue < UiType( CheckBox ); Default( 0 ); UiGroup( "Options/Something, 1" ); >; 

    // If original feature was in range greater than [0..1], you can do this 
    // as an integer slider instead? (yikes!)
    int FeatureValue < Default( 0 ); Range( 0, 5 ); UiGroup( "Options/Something, 1" ); >; 
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This isn't ideal and gets awfully hacky if you had features with more than one option to choose... Whenever new material editor comes out, 
        I hope it will provide more versatile UI to handle various types of data and variables, or even better, just let us define our own 
        editors for variables. Material Editor has a good UX, but it can get very limiting when you want to add some unusual features 
        to your shader. 
    </p>

    <h2>CalculateInstancingObjectToWorldMatrix</h2>
    <p>
       This is a very old function that used to work until August 2025. This helper function takes your <b>vertex input</b> struct 
       and returns <string>float3x4</string> transform matrix, which holds position, scale and rotation of your model. It is no longer 
       working, and you're recommended to use <string>GetTransformMatrix</string> instead.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how some old shaders used to copy transform matrix:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3x4 matObjectToWorld = CalculateInstancingObjectToWorldMatrix( i );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Today, it is recommended to use <b>GetTransformMatrix</b>, this is how you can do it: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3x4 matObjectToWorld = GetTransformMatrix( i.nInstanceTransformID );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>nInstanceTransformID</string> is the unique ID for your current model's instance. This is an integer that
        you can find inside of a <b>vertex input</b> struct. This function returns the same matrix as previous method, 
        so it is a very easy fix for old shaders. 
    </p>

    <h2>VrForward()</h2>
    <p>
        On <a href="https://commits.facepunch.com/514155">January 30th, 2025</a>, default rendering mode <string>VrForward()</string>
        has been renamed to <string>Forward()</string>. This is a more accurate name since both VR and non-VR visuals use the same 
        rendering method, Forward+.  
    </p>
    <p>
        To fix shaders that use old name, just rename <string>VrForward</string> in <string>MODES</string> section:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
MODES 
{
    Forward()
    // ... 
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As of June 2025, both <string>VrForward()</string> and <string>Forward()</string> still work and compile correctly. However,
        it's recommended to stick with <string>Forward()</string> variant from now. 
    </p>

    <h2>Tex2DS and CreateTexture2D</h3>
    <p>
        You may still stumble upon this stuff from time to time. Back when Source 2 was compiling for multiple platforms like DX9 and 
        DX11, devs had to use special macros for sampling and defining Texture2D. Now, when s&box is using Vulkan and lots of graphics 
        backend in Source 2 is probably better than it was pre-s&box, you can interact with textures with less macros, and more 
        native HLSL syntax. 
    </p>

    <h3>Defining Textures</h3>
    <p>
        This is how old shaders used to create new Texture2D objects out of input slots:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateTexture2DWithoutSampler( g_tColor ) < Channel( RGB, Box( Color ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        These days, you can just do this using native HLSL:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Texture2D g_tColor < Channel( RGB, Box( Color ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>CreateTexture2DWithoutSampler()</string> macro literally does the same thing as declaring Texture2D directly. 
        There's no point in using it nowadays. Notice that annotation remains unchanged. There's one big upside of using native 
        HLSL over built-in macros: this makes learning HLSL a bit easier. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There was also another macro, <string>CreateTexture2D</string> - it handled both Texture2D declaration, and also sets up the 
        sampler for this texture. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateTexture2D( g_tOverlayTexture ) < Attribute( "Texture" ); SrgbRead( true ); Filter( ANISOTROPIC ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        These days you can just declare and set up the sampler state yourself. This is how this implementation of <b>g_tOverlayTexture</b>
        with anisotropic sampler would look like using native HLSL: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
SamplerState some_filter < Filter( Anisotropic ); >;
Texture2D g_tOverlaytexture < Attribute( "Texture" ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Reasoning</h3>
    <p>
        All these macros existed during earlier days of Source 2. These days s&box no longer uses DX11 for rendering, and that made 
        these macros somewhat obsolete. They still exist and they're still working, but in the future they may be possibly removed
        (although not confirmed). 
    </p>
    <p>
        There's no reason to avoid using as much native HLSL syntax as possible. Using old macros can add up additional confusion 
        for beginners because they would have to search the internet to find out what every macro does.  
    </p>

    <h3>Sampling Textures</h3>
    <p>
        There was also a special macro for sampling the texture inside of <string>MainPs</string> function:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Tex2DS( g_tColor, g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords.xy ).rgb; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        It does the same thing as <string>Texture.Sample</string>, except with an additional layer of confusing bullshit that you 
        would have to guess if you couldn't search up anything online. This is how it's done now:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
g_tColor.Sample( g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords.xy ).rgb;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        There's a number of other functions like <b>Tex2DLevel</b>, <b>Tex2DGrad</b> and etc.. they're all still valid, however
        there's no reason not to use sampler functions that come with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/sm5-object-texture2d">Texture2D object</a>, which is part of the more modern HLSL 
        I think. 
    </p>

    <h2>ToolsVis mode</h2>
    <p>
        In late 2024, <string>ToolsVis</string> and some other related rendering modes have been removed. Now, tools visualization 
        is handled through shading model (I think) and this mode will not work anymore. Here's how old shaders implemented ToolsVis:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
ToolsVis( S_MODE_TOOLS_VIS ); 									
ToolsWireframe( "vr_tools_wireframe.vfx" ); 					
ToolsShadingComplexity( "vr_tools_shading_complexity.vfx" )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Nowadays, you just have to remove these references from <string>MODES</string> section altogether. 
    </p>

    <h2>Multiview</h2>
    <p>
        In earlier days, s&box has been using multiview which was necessary for VR rendering, as far as I know. It came with a number 
        of special variables and functions that were made for multiview specifically. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#if ( D_MULTIVIEW_INSTANCING )
    GetViewAndSubview( i.nInstanceID, nView, nSubview );
    o.nView = nView;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        None of this shit exists anymore. If you see any functions or variables with "multiview" in the name, remove it. Shaders 
        are working in VR the same way as in non-VR mode. According to Facepunch, maintaining multiview was painful in the shape it was.
    </p>

    <h2>Old Material & Shading API</h2>
    <p>
        Shading and material API went under a number of changes since 2021. These days it's significantly more simple to use, 
        and internally shading model went through a huge number of changes.  
    </p>

    <h3>Material API</h3>
    <p>
        Previously, material class had a different function name that would initialize new Material object in your shader code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Material m = GatherMaterial( i );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now material class can be defined using <string>Material::Init()</string> or <string>Material::From( i )</string>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Old Shading Model API</h3>
    <p>
        In older shaders, if you had to shade the pixel using your material object and pixel input struct, you would have to this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Create and initialize a variable with Material class
Material mat = mat.GatherMaterial( i );
m.Albedo = some_texture_blahblah.rgb;

// Initialize a variable with the ShadingModelValveStandard class, then finalize pixel material
ShadingModelValveStandard sm;
return FinalizePixelMaterial( i, m, sm );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now, shading model has been renamed to <string>ShadingModelStandard</string>, and it is much simpler to use. There's no 
        <string>FinalizePixelMaterial</string> anymore, instead there's a method called <string>::Shade()</string> in the standard 
        shading model. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how code snipper above would've been done with modern API:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Material m = Material::Init();
m.Albedo = some_texture_blahblah.rgb;

return ShadingModelStandard::Shade( i, m );
    </code></pre>

    <h2>INSTANCED_SHADER_PARAMS</h2>
    <p>
        Previously, you had to include <string>INSTANCED_SHADER_PARAMS</string> into the input for <string>MainVs</string> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PixelInput MainVs( INSTANCED_SHADER_PARAMS( VertexInput i ) )
{
    // ...
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You don't need this anymore. Instead, just refer VertexInput data directly. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
{
    // ...
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Old Depth Mode</h2>
    <p>
        Some old shaders define <string>Depth</string> with a reference to a .vfx file. It looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Depth( "vr_depth_only.vfx" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        These days, you can just do <string>Depth()</string>, or <string>Depth( S_MODE_DEPTH )</string> if you want to perform 
        any specific operations during the depth prepass. 
    </p>
