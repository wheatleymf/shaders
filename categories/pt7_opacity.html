        I probably don't have to explain why opacity in shaders exist, and in which cases you may need to enable it. Without any long introduction, 
        let's start by adding a new static combo: transparency (especially with alpha test) does have some slight impact on the performance,
        so it makes sense to wrap opacity functionality into an optional feature.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In <string>FEATURES</string> section, add a new feature: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Feature( F_TRANSPARENCY, 0..1, "Transparency" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then move over back to fragment shader and add a new static combo:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
StaticCombo( S_TRANSPARENCY, F_TRANSPARENCY, Sys( ALL ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now we can implement new combo-specific code. Besides of setting up a texture input and Texture2D for the opacity map, 
        you also need to set certain <string>BoolAttribute</string> and <string>RenderState</string> properties that will indicate 
        to the engine that this shader needs opacity rendering:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#if ( S_TRANSPARENCY )
	BoolAttribute( translucent, true );
	RenderState( BlendEnable, true );

	CreateInputTexture2D( Opacity, Linear, 8, "", "_opacity", "Material,10/Transparency,10/70", Default( 1 ) );
	Texture2D g_tOpacity < Channel( R, Box( Opacity ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( false ); >;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Render States indicate various things about how shader is rendered on screen. There are many properties, and you can read more 
        about them <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Shader_States">on s&box wiki</a>. There's lots of them, but you don't have to 
        worry about anything else other than <string>BlendEnable</string> for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        <string>BlendEnable</string> specifies that blending is enabled for this shader, what is required for rendering transparency 
        in this shader. Without this state, your material will appear opaque. <string>translucent</string> in BoolAttribute thing 
        is also necessary for correct rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <string>MainPs</string>, add another combo-specific <string>#if</string> section: sample opacity map and store it 
        in Material's <string>Opacity</string> slot. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#if ( S_TRANSPARENCY )
    mat.Opacity = g_tOpacity.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).r; 
#endif
    </code></pre>

        If you enable "Transparency" feature and try adding an opacity mask, you'll see that your object actually appears transaprent now, 
        very nice! However, something funky will happen if you try enabling backfaces on this material...
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt7_backfaces.png">
    <p>
        Everything behind the surface that renders in front of you looks a bit off... why is there some missing, empty spot on the right?
        This is one of the quirks about transparency renderig in shaders. Unfortunately sorting opacity in the correct order still doesn't have 
        an ideal solution, but there's a opacity rendering technique called <b>"alpha to coverage"</b> (also sometimes called as "alpha test")
        which is aimed to solve this problem. 
    </p>

    <h2>Alpha to Coverage</h2>
    <p>
        To implement "alpha to coverage", please go back to <string>FEATURES</string>, this time add a new feature for the alpha test 
        specifically. Also, to make features function nicely, let's add a feature rule which will prevent enabling alpha test for given material, 
        if transparency is turned off. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Feature( F_ALPHA_TEST, 0..1, "Transparency");
    
// Makes F_ALPHA_TEST unavailable if F_TRANSPARENCY isn't enabled yet. 
FeatureRule( Requires1( F_ALPHA_TEST, F_TRANSPARENCY ), "Alpha test is available only with transparency enabled!" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Feature rules is a special thing that allows excluding/including certain features between each other. Besides of making some features 
        more obvious to use for your lovely artists, this also allows slightly cutting down compilation time since this will also exclude 
        generating shader variants for features that are set to be incompatible with each other.  
    </p>
    <p>
        You can read more about feature rules, their examples & usage on <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/AnatomyOfVFX#featurerules">wiki page here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, inside the combo-specific code block for the transparency, we need to add another RenderState property, this time for 
        <string>AlphaToCoverageEnable</string>. Second argument in <b>RenderState</b> is expecting a supported option, most of the time 
        it'll be a boolean. We can explicitly link this new alpha test feature to represent the current value for this state: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
RenderState( AlphaToCoverageEnable, F_ALPHA_TEST );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Yeah! No need to create another static combo and shove another <string>#if</string> block for things like render states, bool attributes, 
        and a few other things, you can directly link the feature instead. Now, if you try enabling backfaces and alpha test, you'll see that 
        your transparent material no longer freaks out!
    </p>

    <h2>Some Performance Quirks</h2>
    <p>
        Alpha test is very helpful for materials where you want to render backfaces, or when single mesh with a transparent material somehow 
        overlaps with itself. Best example would be foliage: for trees and other things, alpha test is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this doesn't come as a cheap solution. While this will be harmless for simple things like windows and some other primitive 
        surfaces, alpha test can get increasingly more expensive to render when there's a huge amount of transparent objects around. Again, 
        foliage often suffers from it; lots of trees, grass and bushes can make rendering much more costly. So please be careful with transparency, 
        and don't go too crazy with transparent stuff. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next time I'll tell about vertex colors, what are the most common use cases for them, and how can you add vertex colors in your shader.
        It will be very simple!
