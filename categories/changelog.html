    <h2>2025</h2>
    <h3>September 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>September 4th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Updated article header styling. Should stand out a bit more now. :-) 
            </li>
            <li>
                Category navigation panel has been slightly re-aligned. If you stay at the top of the page, it will be slightly 
                offset to avoid overlapping with the header section. If you scroll below, it will go back to it's original position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigation bar on the left is now hidden when your screen width is less than 800px, currently there's no way to make it 
                visible if your screen is too small, but I can probably change this behavior if requested.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>August 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>August 28th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Removed <b>CalculateInstancingObjectToWorldMatrix</b> from function page, since this function no longer works.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added references to <string>GetTransformMatrix</string> and <string>ComputeMatrixScale</string> on common functions 
                page which allow extracting object's transform matrix, and quickly calculating model's scale. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Removed "Vertex Stuff" category from common functions page, and moved <string>Position3WsToPs</string> to 
                <b>Miscellaneous</b>. Updated the description to be more correct, since this function sometimes can be used outside 
                of vertex shaders. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated <b>Relics of the Past</b> page with new information about <b>CalculateInstancingObjectToWorldMatrix</b>. 
                Described what happened to this function, and added a code snippet that shows how modern shaders can get model's 
                transform matrix now. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>July 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>July 31st, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Functions page has been updated to provide slightly more detailed description on various BRDF-related functions
                and arguments that they take. 
                <br><br>I've also added reference to AnisoGGX, which is used to calculate anisotropic specular lobe. Added reference 
                to a function which allows getting object-to-world matrix for current instance. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>June 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>June 24th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="functions">Common Functions</article-ref>, which references bunch of 
                somewhat unknown, or obscure functions existing in s&box. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated HLSL highlighter to support some s&box specific names.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated CSS to support infinitely tall navigation column.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="pt14_skybox">Skybox Shader</article-ref>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> 
        <b>June 10th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Screenspace Reflections" article has been delisted. It may be a temporary decision: there were some big changes 
                to dynamic reflection stuff in s&box, and it affected the tracing class. I don't have much time to update the article 
                currently, but this will change soon, hopefully! I apologize for the inconvenience. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>March 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>March 28th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                New article released: <article-ref link="pt13_cbuffer">Part 13. Constant Buffers</article-ref>. Should've done this 
                sooner and I don't think it should be put this late into the course, but I hope it's fine for you guys. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <b>March 24th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                New article released: <b>Part 12. Screenspace Reflections</b>. Diving into basic reflections, 
                using helper s&box class!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>March 9th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed a small mistake in the code example for texture builder annotations. (thanksy trundler)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>March 3rd, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Merged pull request by <a href="https://github.com/Shinyshark1">Shinyshark</a> that improves grammar in first three 
                chapters. Thank you!! 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated welcome page with a new "contributors" section. Currently there's just one person, but it's worth crediting 
                every person that helps improving this website. ❤️
            </li>
            <li>
                Added <string>contributor-tag</string> that displays contributor's profile picture, name, and redirects to a specified 
                URL when clicking on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed broken link to "Depth" page in Facepunch docs (postprocessing fog article)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>January 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>January 31st, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented loading screen boilerplate. It will hide all ugly missing icons and font before page was fully loaded. 
                If user has encountered an error during load that gets page stuck in loading state forever, they will be notified 
                in 20 seconds. This screen is visible only during the initial page load.     
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigation menu will no longer show up when user is sliding around the code snippets in articles.
                Improved code organization for handling navigation in mobile mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed the way <string>h2</string>/<string>h3</string> tags are wrapped to prevent them rendering beyond 
                phone's viewport maximum width. This isn't perfect but should fix text rendering across all potential 
                browsers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 30th, 2025</b>: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Implemented basic mobile phone support</b>. This should greatly improve the quality of life for mobile users, 
                    at least layout should not be fundamentally fucked anymore. Swipe to the right to open a navigation menu, 
                    swipe to the left to hide it. This is an early iteration so please let me know if anything breaks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Night theme switch button will be displayed only when you have navigation bar open. At the moment, 
                    quick navigation with headings on the right isn't available on mobile phones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current method for detecting mobile phones is done by checking if user has appropriate viewport width, 
                    if you're using tablets/desktops and see mobile layout enabled anyway, please let me know.  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated all shader files to include <string>Depth</string> mode. This was an oversight on my end, this must 
                be featured by default because shadows won't cast without depth prepass. Sorry!
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated <article-ref link="pt2_firstshader">Your First Unlit Shader</article-ref>. s&box will change the name 
                of the main rendering mode from <string>VrForward</string> to <string>Forward</string>. Added a reference to 
                "Relics of the Past" article. Fixed typo. Added a very little notation about forward+ rendering. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Shader files have also been updated to use <string>Forward</string> mode from now on.
            </li>
            <li>
                Relics of the Past article has been updated to feature old mode <string>VrForward</string>
                and what should be used instead of it from now on. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a dedicated changelog page that you're currently reading. :-)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <b>January 22nd, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="triplanar">Triplanar Mapping</article-ref>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        <b>January 21st, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="pt11_framebuffer">Part 11. Frame Buffer</article-ref>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="procedural">Procedural Noises and Shapes</article-ref>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a link to a discussion thread in s&box discord on welcome page.

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 19th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented <string>nav-item</string> custom HTML tag that replaces old <string>a</string> tag on index page.
                This should make easier to maintain, edit and implement new article links in the index navigation column.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added <string>notranslate</string> to all material icons so they wouldn't be affected by translators and break 
                how icons are rendered on page. Tested with Google Translate but I am not sure if this will 
                work with other machine translators. Fixes issue #1 on GitHub. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated <article-ref link="contributing">Contributing</article-ref> page to document new added custom tag. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a button that toggles between light and night themes
            </li>
            <li>
                Bunch of CSS stylesheet re-organization to improve amount of content that can be adjusted for custom themes 
            </li>
            <li>
                Some little JS code cleanup, new comments and removal of some dead code from July 2024. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Released a new three-part course on post-processing shaders:

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented <string>article-ref</string> tag which allows linking and redirecting users to mentioned article 
                by clicking on the tag. Works a bit smoother than <string>a</string> links. 
            </li>
            <li>
                URL now correctly updates the current state and query when switching between articles using <string>article-ref</string>
                tag on pages. 
            </li>

                Huge number of phrasing improvements and proofreading for most of the articles on website

            <li>
                Uploaded bunch of sample models and materials to use for some articles that rely on specific visuals/mesh data

    <p>
        <b>January 17th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented new custom tag, <string>article-header</string> and updated the documentation to show how to 
                correctly use this tag. Replaces previous custom <string>div</string> layout which was annoying to maintain. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated test page with latest custom tags
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented article navigation on the right: list of headings and subheadings are populated at runtime, 
                and JS will automatically highlight the section you're currently reading on page. Clicking on these headings 
                will automatically scroll your page to the vertical position of given section.

        <b>January 16th, 2025</b>: (internal pre-release)

                stuff you need to know if you plan to edit or submit new articles on the website
            </li>
            <li>
                JS: fixed innerHTML being updated twice, which was messing with custom elements and causing them to render 
                twice on page
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-enabled scrolling in the navigation bar since amount of articles won't fit on 1080p screen anymore
            </li>
            <li>
