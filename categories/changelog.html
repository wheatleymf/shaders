    <h3>January 2025</h3>
    <p>
        <b>January 30th, 2025</b>: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Updated all shader files to include <string>Depth</string> mode. This was an oversight on my end, this must 
                be featured by default because shadows won't cast without depth prepass. Sorry!
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated <article-ref link="pt2_firstshader">Your First Unlit Shader</article-ref>. s&box will change the name 
                of the main rendering mode from <string>VrForward</string> to <string>Forward</string>. Added a reference to 
                "Relics of the Past" article. Fixed typo. Added a very little notation about forward+ rendering. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Shader files have also been updated to use <string>Forward</string> mode from now on.
            </li>
            <li>
                Relics of the Past article has been updated to feature old mode <string>VrForward</string>
                and what should be used instead of it from now on. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a dedicated changelog page that you're currently reading. :-)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>January 22nd, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="triplanar">Triplanar Mapping</article-ref>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 21st, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="pt11_framebuffer">Part 11. Frame Buffer</article-ref>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="procedural">Procedural Noises and Shapes</article-ref>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a link to a discussion thread in s&box discord on welcome page.  
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 19th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented <string>nav-item</string> custom HTML tag that replaces old <string>a</string> tag on index page.
                This should make easier to maintain, edit and implement new article links in the index navigation column.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added <string>notranslate</string> to all material icons so they wouldn't be affected by translators and break 
                how icons are rendered on page. Tested with Google Translate but I am not sure if this will 
                work with other machine translators. Fixes issue #1 on GitHub. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated <article-ref link="contributing">Contributing</article-ref> page to document new added custom tag. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a button that toggles between light and night themes
            </li>
            <li>
                Bunch of CSS stylesheet re-organization to improve amount of content that can be adjusted for custom themes 
            </li>
            <li>
                Some little JS code cleanup, new comments and removal of some dead code from July 2024. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 18th, 2025</b>: (initial public release)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article: <article-ref link="oldshaders">Relics of the Past</article-ref>
            </li>
            <li>
                Released a new three-part course on post-processing shaders:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <article-ref link="postprocessing_basics">Basic Postprocessing</article-ref>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <article-ref link="postprocessing_fog">Screenspace Fog</article-ref>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <article-ref link="postprocessing_dither">Dithering Effect</article-ref>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented <string>article-ref</string> tag which allows linking and redirecting users to mentioned article 
                by clicking on the tag. Works a bit smoother than <string>a</string> links. 
            </li>
            <li>
                URL now correctly updates the current state and query when switching between articles using <string>article-ref</string>
                tag on pages. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Scroll position for each article is now locally saved and restored every time you open this article again. 
                This will persist between every session as it's saved in your browser's local storage. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Huge number of phrasing improvements and proofreading for most of the articles on website
            </li>
            <li>
                Uploaded bunch of sample models and materials to use for some articles that rely on specific visuals/mesh data
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 17th, 2025</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented new custom tag, <string>article-header</string> and updated the documentation to show how to 
                correctly use this tag. Replaces previous custom <string>div</string> layout which was annoying to maintain. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated test page with latest custom tags
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented article navigation on the right: list of headings and subheadings are populated at runtime, 
                and JS will automatically highlight the section you're currently reading on page. Clicking on these headings 
                will automatically scroll your page to the vertical position of given section. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>January 16th, 2025</b>: (internal pre-release)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new article <article-ref link="contributing">Contributing</article-ref> which documents most of the important 
                stuff you need to know if you plan to edit or submit new articles on the website
            </li>
            <li>
                JS: fixed innerHTML being updated twice, which was messing with custom elements and causing them to render 
                twice on page
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-enabled scrolling in the navigation bar since amount of articles won't fit on 1080p screen anymore
            </li>
            <li>
                Added <string>download-file</string> tag
            </li>

                Finished writing first ten main articles and a few reference pages. Lots of work on styling and JS frontend script, 
                and lots of other changes that I can't remember in details anymore..
