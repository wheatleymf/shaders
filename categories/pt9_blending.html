        Texture blending is extremely useful for adding extra detail on your material. Nearly all modern games use multiple texture layers and blending 
        to increase the detail of environment. Although I've mentioned it already in previous article, but Rust utilizes it a lot: lots of buildings 
        you see on monuments have these details using vertex colors and texture layers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, we'll implement two types of texture blending: one uses vertex colors to determine where certain layers will be applied 
        on your mesh, and second uses world-space normals for realtime "layering" effect. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Blending using Vertex Colors</h2>

    <h3>Setting up mesh in Blender</h3>
    <p>
        First, make sure you have a test mesh ready. If you are not familiar with vertex colors or vertex painting yet, 
        check out the <article-ref link="pt8_vertexcolor">Vertex Colors</article-ref> article. While in vertex paint more, select pitch black color and do <string>Ctrl+X</string> to apply this color for all vertices.
        Then, using color picker, pick 100% red color and paint the area you want to cover with a 2nd texture. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt9_redchannel.png">
    <p>
        Now export it with vertex colors includes in linear color space. Import it in s&box, set up the mesh using ModelDoc, assign it 
        to use the material with your custom shader, that's it. Now, let's move to the shader: we'll need to adds lots of new things, 
        and perfectly you may want to re-organize some existing variables for easier access.
    </p>

    <h3>Set up new static combo</h3>
    <p>
        There's no necessity to keep all blending functionality enabled by default, so let's branch it by wrapping it behind another 
        static combo. In <string>FEATURES</string>, define a new feature: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Feature( F_BLEND_LAYER, 0..1, "Extra Features" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now go to to <string>PS</string> block and implement new static combo with a link to this new feature.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
StaticCombo( S_BLEND_LAYER, F_BLEND_LAYER, Sys( ALL ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Don't forget that this shader will utilize vertex colors for blending. So if you haven't set up VertexInput to read and process 
        colors inside of a vertex shader, check out the previous article. It's an easy thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, we'll need to do add lots of new texture inputs. To give more control for artist, we'll also implement unique variables 
        to let you control texture scale & tint, normal map strength, and emission per-layer. Under declaration of texture inputs and 
        Texture2Ds for main textures, add a new <string>#if</string> for <string>S_BLEND_LAYER</string> combo.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
    // 
    // Second layer rendered on top, create input slots
    //
#if ( S_BLEND_LAYER )
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerColor,           Srgb, 	8, "", "_color", "Material B,20/Albedo Map,20/10", Default3( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ) );						
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerColorTintMask,   Linear, 8, "", "_tint", "Material B,20/Albedo Map,20/20", Default1( 1 ) );						
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerNormal,          Linear, 8, "NormalizeNormals", "_normal", "Material B,20/Normal Map,20/30", Default3( 0.5, 0.5, 1.0 ) );		
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerRoughness,       Linear, 8, "", "_rough", "Material B,20/Roughness,20/40", Default( 1 ) );											
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerMetalness,       Linear, 8, "", "_metal",  "Material B,20/Metalness,20/50", Default( 0 ) );									
    CreateInputTexture2D( LayerAmbientOcclusion,Linear, 8, "", "_ao",  "Material B,20/Ambient Occlusion,20/60", Default( 1 ) );

    // Input slot for 2nd layer emission if it's enabled
    #if ( S_EMISSION )
        CreateInputTexture2D( LayerEmission, Srgb, 8, "", "_em", "Material B,20/Emission,20/70", Default3( 0, 0, 0 ) );
        Texture2D layerEmissionMap < Channel( RGB, Box( LayerEmission ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;

        float g_flLayerEmissionStrength < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 8 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Material B,20/Emission,20/71"); >;            
    #endif  

    Texture2D layerColorMap  < Channel( RGB, Box( LayerColor ), Srgb ); Channel( A, Box( LayerColorTintMask ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    Texture2D layerNormalMap < Channel( RGB, Box( LayerNormal ), Linear ); OutputFormat( DXT5 ); SrgbRead( false ); >; 
    Texture2D g_tRmaLayer    < Channel( R, Box( LayerRoughness ), Linear ); Channel( G, Box( LayerMetalness ), Linear); Channel( B, Box( LayerAmbientOcclusion ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead ( false ); >; 

    // Add control sliders same as in Material A, but for Material B.
    float   g_flLayerNormalIntensity < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 3 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Material B,20/Normal Map,20/31" ); >;
    float   LayerTextureScale < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 5 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Material B,20/Layer Settings,20/90" ); >;
    float3  LayerTextureTint < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "Material B,20/Layer Settings,20/91" ); >;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will create the same set of PBR texture inputs as we did for the main material. If emission is enabled on this material, it will 
        generate emission map for this texture too. We're also implementing texture scale, tint and normal strength for this layer specifically, 
        so you wouldn't have just one variable tied to both layers. Although if that's something you prefer, you can delete these variables 
        and use original variables instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, as you can see, this layer does not support opacity - but it can be added if you'd like. I hope you already know enough to do 
        this by yourself, it wouldn't be hard! 
    </p>

    <h3>Sampling and Configuring the Material</h3>
    <p>
        Next, you need to create another <string>#if</string> in MainPs, right after the <string>#IF (S_EMISISON)</string> section. This is
        because you will create new materials and sample new textures. To keep code (somewhat) clean, it'll be better to do when all other code 
        has finished setting up the first material. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// 
// Sample all 2nd layer textures, and create a new Material object.
// Apply same effects as for the first material textures.
// 
#if ( S_BLEND_LAYER )
    // Set up separate UV property for layered texture 
    float2 layer_uv = i.vTextureCoords * LayerTextureScale;

    float4 albedo_l = layerColorMap.Sample( g_sAniso, layer_uv ).rgba;
    float3 normal_l = DecodeNormal( layerNormalMap.Sample( g_sAniso, layer_uv ).rgb );
    normal_l.rg *= g_flLayerNormalIntensity;

    float3 rma_l = g_tRmaLayer.Sample( g_sAniso, layer_uv ).rgb;

    // Create new Material object, this is where new textures will be inserted
    Material layer = Material::Init();

    layer.Albedo = lerp( albedo_l.rgb, albedo_l.rgb * LayerTextureTint, albedo_l.a );
    layer.Normal = TransformNormal( normal_l, i.vNormalWs, i.vTangentUWs, i.vTangentVWs );
    layer.Roughness = rma_l.r;
    layer.Metalness = rma_l.g;
    layer.AmbientOcclusion = rma_l.b;
    layer.TintMask = albedo_l.a;

    // Handle emission mode
    #if ( S_EMISSION )
        layer.Emission = layerEmissionMap.Sample( g_sAniso, layer_uv ).rgb;
    #endif

    // Tip: you can add opacity here too! 

    // Final step: when both materials are set up, we can use Material class' special function "lerp"
    // to quickly lerp two textures together.
    mat = Material::lerp( mat, layer, i.vVertexColor.r );
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This is essentially repeating the same code as for the main material, but with new textures. We're applying same manipulations and 
        effects for albedo tint, texture scale, and normal map strength. It also includes emission if it's enabled. This code can be probably 
        greatly simplified. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Last bit lerps two materials together. This is a special <string>lerp</string> function that comes with the Material class, it is
        specifically written to combine two materials together, because doing it manually for every texture would be abysmally dogshit suicide 
        mission. As a linear control value, we'll be using red channel of vertex colors. This means that spots without red will use main material, 
        while spots where red channel goes up to <b>1</b> will render new layered material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, compile everything and set up the material. You'll need to find another PBR material for this. [note to myself: I probably can 
        just share My Summer Cottage assets]
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt9_blended.png">
    <p>
        Well done! What we did here can be called as <b>linear blending</b>, because it simply lerps between two textures, with control value 
        being just red channel going from 0 to 1. Something you probably noticed is that it doesn't look that good... surely, transition 
        between these two materials can be improved, right? Yeah!
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Height Blend</h3>
    <p>
        Blending between two textures can be significantly improved by using <b>height blend masks</b>, and some extra math. First, add a new texture 
        input for the main material.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateInputTexture2D( HeightMask, Linear, 8, "", "_height", "Material A,10/Height Blend Mask,10/35", Default( 1 ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Since currently Texture2D for normal map uses only three channel, this heightmap can be put into fourth (alpha) channel.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Notice that we've added channel A, which points to the HeightMask input!
Texture2D NormalMap < Channel( RGB, Box( Normal ), Linear ); Channel( A, Box( HeightMask ), Linear ); OutputFormat( DXT5 ); SrgbRead( false ); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        <p>Why are we creating this input slot outside of the S_BLEND_LAYER code?</p>
        <p>
            When this blend feature is disabled, this input will not show up in the material editor anyway. If this input slot isn't used, 
            this channel in the compiled normal map texture will not be used anyway. Please check how true is this,
            but I believe this also will be optimized by the compiler? I honestly don't know. 
        </p>
    </info>
    <p>
        We need to slightly change how normal map is being sampled. Previous code doesn't account for the fourth channel. Remove previous 
        line that decoded the normal map, and do this instead:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Store full RGBA normal map texture separately, then make a new variable 
// that stores only RGB channels and then decodes it. Alpha remains unaffected. 
float4 NormalHeight = NormalMap.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgba; 
float3 normal = DecodeNormal( NormalHeight.rgb );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Before moving forward, let's move back outside of <string>MainPs</string>, because we need to implement a new, custom function 
        that handles prettier texture blend. Anywhere in the <string>PS</string> section, add this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float ComputeBlendWeight( float flBlendIntensity, float flBlendSoftness, float flBlendRevealMask )
{
    float flScaledInput = ( flBlendIntensity * ( 1.0 + ( flBlendSoftness * 2.0 ) ) ) - flBlendSoftness;
    float flMin = flScaledInput - flBlendSoftness;
    float flMax = flScaledInput + flBlendSoftness;

    return 1.0 - saturate( ( flBlendRevealMask - flMin ) / ( flBlendSoftness * 2.0 ) );
}
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        Credit goes to Facepunch and Valve (?) btw. This initially was part of the s&box shader code, but later it was ripped out 
        and this code re-implements this feature. Thanks Ziks!  
    </info>
    <p>
        This function will calculate proper blending between control value (in our case, that's vertex colors), user-defined 
        blend softness, and given height mask. It will also ensure that final value stays within 0-1 radius.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, let's make a new float variable that will control how smooth this blend texture appears. Value closer to 1 will make it look 
        sharper, while 0 will blur the transition a lot. You should put this inside of <string>#if ( S_BLEND_LAYER )</string> in <string>PS</string>    
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float g_flBlendSmoothness < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 1 ); Default( 0.5 ); UiGroup( "Settings,30/Blend Options,30/30"); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now, go into <string>#if ( S_BLEND_LAYER )</string> branch and let's change the third argument in <string>::lerp</string> function,
        and instead of linking to i.vVertexColor, let's use this new function. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
mat = Material::lerp( mat, layer, ComputeBlendWeight( i.vVertexColor.r, g_flBlendSmoothness, NormalHeight.a ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Go to the Material Editor and add a height mask for the main layer. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt9_computeblend.png">
    <p>
        Notice how much natural this transition looks like, giving artists more options to make detailed blending on textures. And by the way, 
        you can blend more than two textures together this way - if you really need it, you can repeat whole process to make texture inputs 
        for 3rd and 4th layers, and then mix them together one by one. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also check how is it done in <string>blendable</string> shader, it is also probably organized much nicer than this code.
    </p>

    <h2>Normal Map Blending</h2>
    <p>
        At last, let's do another fun thing. Let's use world-space normal to determine what area must be covered by the second layer!
        To avoid even more shader combos piling up and increasing the compilation time, let's implement a simple checkbox variable instead.
    </p>

    <h3>Simple Way</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
bool g_bUseWorldSpaceNormals < UiType( CheckBox ); Default( 0 ); UiGroup( "Settings,30/Blend Options,30/31" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then use a simple conditional operator in the lerp function to switch between using vertex colors or world-space normals. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
mat = Material::lerp( mat, layer, ComputeBlendWeight( g_bUseWorldSpaceNormals ? NormalTransformed.b : i.vVertexColor.r, g_flBlendSmoothness, NormalHeight.a ) );
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        Reminder: world-space normals are generated automatically after you process decoded normal map through the helper function
        <string>TransformNormal()</string>. Using decoded normals won't work with this trick because they're in tangent space.
    </info>
    <p>
        Enable this checkbox in material editor and see how texture is always applied at the top of your mesh! Rotate it, scale it, but it will always 
        stay rendering at the top. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt9_normalblend.png">
    <p>
        How does it work? Each channel in world-space normals represent the corresponding axis. Red channel is X axis, green channel is Y axis, 
        and blue channel is Z axis. Since normals are within <b>-1 to 1</b> range, this can be used to determine the normals direction. 
        If you use <b>-NormalTransformed.b</b> instead, it will apply this texture from the bottom, because negative value will represent 
        <b>Z down</b>. If you do <b>NormalTransformed.r</b>, it will be applying the texture on <b>positive X axis</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I highly recommend messing around with how world-space normals work because this can be a very good and interactive way to understand 
        how normals work, and what kind of data they represent. Don't forget, you can access all vector components using suffixes <string>RGBA</string>
        or <string>XYZW</string>, both will be valid, and probably XYZW makes more sense when working with normals. 
    </p>

    <h3>Direction and Dot Product</h3>
    <p>
        Last, extra feature: instead of hardcoding this layer to blend only with the <b>Z up</b> of normals, let's allow artists 
        define normal direction themselves. Make a new float3 vector variable with range clamped in -1 to 1. 
        Then, in code, you will use <b>dot product</b> of <string>NormalTransformed</string> and this variable. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Must be inside of #if ( S_BLEND_LAYER ) block in PS too!
float3 g_vNormalDirections < UiType( Slider ); Range3( -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ); Default3( 0, 0, 0 ); UiGroup( "Settings,30/Blend Options,31" ); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Them, in lerp function, replace <string>NormalTransformed.b</string> with HLSL's built-in math function which will calculate
        the dot product: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
mat = Material::lerp( mat, layer, ComputeBlendWeight( g_bUseWorldSpaceNormals ? dot( NormalTransformed, g_vNormalDirections ) : i.vVertexColor.r, g_flBlendSmoothness, NormalHeight.a ) );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/pt9_dotproduct.png">
    <p>
        Now you can define any direction of blend, as well as combine multiple axis together.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are probably more ways to utilize blending and how can it be done, but so far I've shared two features I have used myself 
        in <b>My Summer Cottage</b> and <b>Deathcard</b>.
