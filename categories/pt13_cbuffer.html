        Constant buffers is a nice way to pass whole structs of data into the shader. If you have a big chunk of data that 
        you don't want to pass as each separate attribute, and/or if you have this data stored as a struct in C#, you can just 
        pass them once as a constant buffer.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting in up C#</h3>
    <p>
        Constant buffers in HLSL are defined as a <string>cbuffer</string>. In C#, they're assigned to the shader by using 
        method called <string>SetData</string> in RenderAttributes object. Here's an example where I am passing struct of data 
        as a constant buffer into scene's global render attributes:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
// As an example, here's a definition of a simple struct:
public struct CoolData
{
    public Vector3 Position;
    public float Value;

    // Stupidly primitive constructor 
    public CoolData( Vector3 position, float value )
    {
        Position = position;
        Value = value;
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
    // Initialize a new struct object and then pass it as a constant buffer into
    // the scene render attributes.
    CoolData data = new( new Vector3( 5 ), 0.5f );
    Scene.RenderAttributes.SetData( "ConstantBufferName", data );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <b>Important!</b> The first argument in <string>SetData</string>, that string name, is what you must also use as a name 
        for the <string>cbuffer</string> in your shader file. 
    </p>

    <h3>Setting up in HLSL</h3>
    <p>
        And this is how constant buffer is defined in a shader. As I've mentioned, your <string>cbuffer</string> must match the 
        name that you've set in C#. You don't need to define any additional data other than the constant buffer itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Constant buffers can be defined in any shader program block (like <string>PS</string>, or <string>VS</string>, etc...), 
        or inside of a <string>COMMON</string> block if you'd like to make this data shared between all shader stages. Don't put it 
        into shader's main function like <string>MainPs</string>, it must be outside of any functions.  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
cbuffer ConstantBufferName 
{
    float3 Position;
    float Value;
};
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Be Aware: Data Mismatch</h3>
    <p>
        Also make sure that all properties in this struct defined in exact same order as in your C# struct. If order is incorrect,
        or types are mismatching (for example, using <string>float2</string> for <string>Vector3</string>), you may end up 
        getting incorrect, garbled data.
    </p>
    <p>
        All types have fixed byte size. This is especially important if you'll be making compute shaders with structured buffers. 
        How does this mismatch happen? Let's say you have a C# struct with a <string>Vector3</string> property, but in a constant
        buffer you're defining it as a <string>float2</string> instead. Vector3, which is represented as a float3 in shaders, 
        has a fixed size of <b>12 bytes</b>, while float2 uses <b>8 bytes</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That's 4 bytes of data that gets cut off! And if there's any other variable followed by it, it will try to read first 4 bytes
        that it isn't supposed to. As a result, you get a steaming pile of data mess. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are really curious how data layout works in GPU buffers, here's a nice helper website that can visualize 
        variables and how they are aligned in structs: <a href="https://maraneshi.github.io/HLSL-ConstantBufferLayoutVisualizer/">[click here]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's probably worth to tell a bit more details about byte alignment and other rules, but I will likely come back to it 
        in the compute shader guides. 
    </p>

    <h3>Usage in Shaders</h3>
    <p>
        You can access any data from this constant buffer by directly referencing it's properties. It's very simple: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
{ ... }

cbuffer ConstantBufferName 
{
    float3 Position;
    float Value;
};

{ ... }

PixelInput MainVs( PixelInput i )
{
    // Dead simple: move the world-space vertex, 
    // then update it's projection-space coordinates.
    PixelInput o = ProcessVertex( i );
    o.vPositionWs += Position * Value; 
    o.vPositionPs = Position3WsToPs( o.vPositionWs );

    return FinalizeVertex( o );
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As it is implied by the buffer's name, all of this data is constant. You cannot edit these values from HLSL, you can only read them
        and use in your shader code. You still can update struct's data and push it to the shader from C# anytime. 
    </p>
