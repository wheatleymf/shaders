        There's one little thing worth clarifying, since there's a chance that you might run it at some point, especially as a beginner artist. 
        Not every normal map is the same. Surface normals can be defined in various spaces, such as <b>tangent</b> and <b>world space</b>,
        and normal format can be different, too - <b>OpenGL</b> (+Y axis) or <b>DirectX</b> (-Y axis) formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        This short article will clarify the difference, and how can you visually tell the difference between normal map types. Also, I'll show 
        a quick example of how normal map looks like deconstructed.
    </p>

    <h3>Normal Map Format</h3>
    <p>
        I don't know why, but <b>OpenGL</b> and <b>DirectX</b> ended up implementing two different normal map formats, with the only difference 
        being the orientation of Y axis. Just take a look on the image:
    </p>

    <p>
        s&box uses <b>OpenGL</b> format. If you have a normal map in DirectX format, you can open any image editor software that supports 
        editing specific image channels, and simply invert the green channel. That'll convert the normal map into OpenGL format.
        Using incorrect format won't instantly break your entire game, however this will cause inaccurate shading. 
    </p>

    <h3>Normal Space</h3>
    <p>
        Surface normals can be defined in varying ways. There are <b>tangent space</b> normals. They usually appear mostly blue, 
        with other colors showing up on surface bumps and other spots of your texture. Tangent-space normals are automatically 
        transformed into world-space normals at runtime via shaders, at least this is what s&box shaders do. 
        This is the exact type of normal map you should be using for s&box, and usually most other game engines require tangent-space normals too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other type are <b>object-space</b> normals. It usually appears rainbow-ish, 
        if that makes sense. Each channel represents normals in world space, so red channel is X axis, green channel is Y axis, blue channel is Z axis.
        Generally they are used for baking and texturing purposes, so you shouldn't use these as an input normal map for your materials.  
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also <b>world-space</b> normals. Visually, they are very similar to object-space normals, with the only difference is that usually 
        they are generated at runtime via shaders, by transforming material's tangent-space normal map into world-space. Instead of being baked as object-space 
        normals, they are constantly re-calculated and are linked to world coordinates.  
    </p>
    <p>
        To calculate world-space normals using tangent-spawn normal map, you can use a helper function that comes with s&box out of the box. 
        It will require mesh geometric normals, and tangents data - assuming that you're using <string>PixelInput</string> struct:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// Assuming that you're PixelInput struct, that contains tangents (i.vTangentUWs/i.vTangentVWs)
// and geometric normals (i.vNormalWs). Assuming that you have a Texture2D named "normal".

Material myMaterial = Material::Init();

float3 tangentNormals = DecodeNormal( normal.Sample( g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords.xy ) );
myMaterial.Normal = TransformNormal( tangentNormals, i.vNormalWs, i.vTangentUWs, i.vTangentVWs );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        If you're using s&box default shading model, you always must transform your normals into world space! Otherwise you'll probably run 
        into weird, incorrect shading on your meshes. 
    </p>
