    s&box has a built-in helper code library that handles <b>triplanar mapping</b>. This is an easy way to implement triplanar 
    mapping to your shader if it requires it for your desired visuals. 

    <h2>What is Triplanar Mapping?</h2>
    <p>
        Triplanar mapping is a technique that allows sampling the texture in world-space coordinates, without using mesh UVs: 
        it only requires model's geometric data (which is always available as <string>i.vNormalWs</string>), 
        sampler state, pixel's world-space position, and texture itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Such texture is sampled three times, in three different directions, then blended together. As a result, you get a texture 
        that is binded to world-space coordinates instead of model's UVs, projecting correctly in all directions: this texture 
        will be not be affected by model's transforms like rotation, position or scale. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example from <b>My Summer Cottage</b> and early version of cliff shader, where I am using triplanar mapping to 
        sample the base rock texture onto the surface. This allows me transforming the cliff in any way, where important details are 
        still affected by shape adjustments, but base rock texture stays consistent & unaffected.

    <h3>Triplanar Downsides</h3>
    <p>
        Triplanar samples same texture <b>three times</b> from three different directions. Three samples per texture isn't very good 
        for the performance, especially if you have many textures in your shader. Use triplanar only if you're sure that you really 
        need it for your shader. 
    </p>

    <h2>Implementing Triplanar Mapping</h2>
    <p>
        This is the function that you need to use to sample the texture using triplanar mapping: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Tex2DTriplanar( Texture2D texture, SamplerState samplerState, float3 vPositionWs, float3 vNormalWs, float2 vTile, float flBlend, float2 vTexScale )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Let's explain every argument that this function takes: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>texture</string> - original Texture2D objects that holds the data you want to sample using triplanar 
                mapping. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>samplerState</string> - sampler state that will be used for sampling these textures. You can use any global 
                sampler available in s&box like <string>g_sPointWrap</string>, or implement your own. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>vPositionWs</string> - world-space position of given pixel. By default, PixelInput doesn't hold the data for it, 
                but you can get the value yourself. I'll show how to do it later. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>vNormalWs</string> - geometric world-space normal data of your mesh. You can access it from your PixelInput struct 
                using <b>i.vNormalWs</b> property. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>optional</b> <string>vTile</string> - affects how many times this texture will be tiled (repeated). Higher values 
                will make the texture appear significantly smaller. Accepts float2 value. Default value is <b>512</b>, which makes texture stupidly 
                small. I recommend using <b>1</b> or less. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>optional</b> <string>flBlend</string> - blend factor. Defines the size of blending gradient where two sample 
                directions overlap. Lower values will make this transition smoother, while greater values will make it more 
                harsh and contain obvious seams. Default value is <b>1.0</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>optional</b> <string>vTexScale</string> - texture scale. Independently adjusts the scale of given texture, 
                accepts float2 value. Default value is <b>1.0</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <info>
            Even thought this function accepts scaling/tiling arguments as <b>float2</b>, you can also pass values
            (for example, <b>0.5</b>) to them as a scalar <b>float</b> too, HLSL will automatically handle this and basically treat this input as <b>float2(0.5, 0.5)</b>.
            If you'd like to adjust scale/tiling just for one of the axis, you'll need to pass the value as a proper float2 vector. 
        </info>
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, if you don't want to get world-space pixel position yourself, there's an alternative <string>Tex2DTriplanar</string>
        function that replaces <b>float3 vPositionWs</b> argument with <b>PixelInput pixelInput</b>, where you can basically pass whole 
        struct and function will handle world-space pixel position on it's own. 
    </p>

    <h3>Importing Triplanar Function</h3>
    <p>
        Include the source file with triplanar functions in your pixel shader code: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#include "common/utils/triplanar.hlsl"
    </code></pre>

    <h3>World-Space Pixel Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
        To get world-space position of a given pixel, you must add <string>g_vCameraPositionWs</string> to the value of 
        PixelInput's <string>vPositionWithOffsetWs</string>:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 vPositionWs = i.vPositionWithOffsetWs, g_vCameraPositionWs;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Sampling with Triplanar</h3>
    <p>
        Your texture can be set up the same way as always. If you'd like, you can define variables for tiling, scaling and 
        blend factor that will be exposed to material editor:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateInputTexture2D( SomeTexture, Srgb, 8, "", "_color", "Material,10/Texture Inputs,10/10", Default3( 1, 0, 1 ) );
Texture2D ColorMap < Channel( RGB, Box( SomeTexture ), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
  
float2 TextureTiling < UiType( Slider ); Range2( 0, 0, 8, 8 ); UiGroup( "Material,10/Triplanar Settings,10/20"); >;
float2 TextureScale < UiType( Slider ); Range2( 0, 0, 16, 16 ); UiGroup( "Material,10/Triplanar Settings,10/21"); >;
float BlendFactor < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 3 ); UiGroup( "Material,10/Triplanar Settings,10/22"); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        In <string>MainPs</string>, this is how you sample the texture: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 tex = Tex2DTriplanar( ColorMap, g_sAniso, i, TextureTiling, BlendFactor, TextureScale ).rgb;
    </code></pre>
