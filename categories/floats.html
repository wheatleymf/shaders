        You probably saw things like <string>float3</string>, <string>float4</string> or <string>int2</string> already. What does it stand for, 
        what does this number in the type's name does?    
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, there are common <b>scalar</b> value types like <string>float</string>, <string>int</string>, <string>uint</string> and etc. They
        work as you expect, they hold a number in a format according to given type. But all these scalar types also have vector types, that represent 
        mathematical vectors with 2, 3 or 4 components. You can't have more than 4 components in one vector. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Any scalar value have vector counterparts: if you need a single variable that holds three different <string>float</string>
        values, you can just initialize it with a <string>float3</string> type. It will be called a 3D vector. Variable with a type of <string>float2</string>
        is a 2D vector. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how you can initialize them:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>float</string>: you just create a new variable with any value, something like this:
                <b>float myvariable = 3.4f;</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float2</string>: these are usually used for things like texture coordinates. 
                <b>float2 2Dcoords = float2( 1, 0 );</b> will create a new 2D floating-point vector that holds values <b>1, 0</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float3</string>: float3 is used for many things: representing colors, position of things in 3D coordinates (for example: world-space
                position of pixels or vertices), representing normals, direction, and many other things.
                <b>float3 normals = float3( 0, 0, 1 );</b> will create a new float3 variable that holds values 0, 0, 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>float4</string>: float4 is a 4D vector that holds four floating-point values. For example, when you're returning a pixel in s&box shaders, 
                it is expected that it is passed as a float4 vector. 
                <b>float4 pixel = float4( 1, 0, 0, 1 );</b> will create a new float4 variable. Assuming that it will be used to render 
                final color returned from this shader, it will create a pure red color with alpha (opacity) channel set at 1.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Identical things can be done for other scalar values, like integers, signed integers, doubles, or halfs. 
    </p>

    <h2>Accessing Components</h2>
    <p>
        HLSL allows accessing components of vectors really easily, and quickly swizzle them too.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways you can access these components: either using <string>.RGBA</string>, or <string>.XYZW</string> layout. 
        There's no difference between them, you can use either of them, regardless of how your variable is being used in code. 
        Each letter represents each component in corresponding order. This is how you can access <b>float4</b>'s second component: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// this will return "0.2".
// alternatively, you can use ".y" suffix
float4 example = float4( 0, 0.2, -3, 2 );
float onecomponent = example.g;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
       You can access multiple components as well. Another neat thing is that you can access components using these suffix in any order.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// This will return 2D vector with values of ( -1, 1 ).
// This is technically called "swizzling". 
float3 example = float3( -1, 0, 1 );
float2 twocomponents = example.xz;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Sometimes, there are cases when you need to fit scalar value into a multi-component vector. For example, you have a variable 
        with a type of <string>float</string>, and you need to put it into first three components of a <string>float4</string> vector, while 4th 
        component is defined separately. How can you do that? Very easily!
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// Weird task: fit "float" inside a float4 vector, where 4th is initialized separately:
float SomeValue = 0.455f;
float4 pixel = float4( SomeValue.xxx, 1 );
    </code></pre>   
    <p>
        This allows quickly duplicating and swizzling components in a very compact way. Instead of doing something tedious like 
        <string>float4( value.x, value.x, value.x, 1 )</string>, you can just what I did in the sample code. It indicates copying 
        X component for all three channels, then HLSL figures out the rest. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can do something like this too: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
// Create "swizzled" 3D vector that returns ( 2, 2, 0 ).
// Integers can have vectors too, and support these tricks too!
int4 vector = float4( 2, 5, 0, 7 );
int3 swizzled = vector.xxz; 
    </code></pre>  
    <p>
        As you can see, component suffixes are very flexible. And again, don't forget that you can use <string>RGBA</string> suffixes. 
        They're identical to each other. <b>XYZW</b> represents coordinates, while <b>RGBA</b> stands for "red, green, blue, alpha"; which may be more convenient 
        if you're working with vectors/scalar values that represent color. 
    </p>

    <h2>Float Vectors as Colors</h2>
    <p>
        While you probably can wrap your head around the concept of vectors representing mathematical bullshit like coordinates,
        normals and other boring stuff, you're probably curious about HLSL data representing colors.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Floating-point</b> values (<string>float</string>) is the main value type that is used for representing colors: since all color 
        is represented with values within the <b>(0 - 1)</b> range, values must have a good precision, and integer clearly wouldn't work for this.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Color maps (things like albedo or normal maps) consist of three channels: <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, and <b>green</b>. This means that for color maps, you will need
        at least <string>float3</string> vector. For grayscale maps like masks, roughness/metalness/AO maps, you'll need just one <string>float</string>. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/texturestoring.png">
    <p>
        If you open a colored image in Photoshop and open channel layers, you'll see that image consists of three grayscale channels. Since 
        grayscale images require just one <string>float</string>, when they're stacked together, they turn into a 3D vector! 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how normal maps work too: when you deconstruct a normal map into separate channels, (see: <b>Normal Map Types</b>) it's just three grayscale maps, where 
        first channel is red (X axis), second channel is green (Y axis), and third channel is blue (Z axis). While normal maps are not meant 
        to be used as a visible color map, this format allows easily packing three channels of data in a single file, which is convenient 
        and good for saving up some memory space.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Texture Packing</h2>
    <p>
        There's one useful technique that I recommend using when you have a shader with bunch of texture maps. For example, if you have a color map 
        (that's three components), and one grayscale tint mask, instead of creating a separate <string>float3</string> for the color map and separate 
        <string>float</string> for the tint mask, you can pack them in a single <string>float4</string> vector. This is highly recommended 
        for packing texture inputs: compiled textures are saved onto disk, and reducing amount of unique texture map files is nice.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This also allows sampling both color map and tint mask once, instead of twice. Doing too many samples in your code isn't good for the 
        performance, so always to try pack things together! Although keep in mind that if you want to sample some textures with varying UV values, 
        you won't be able to pack them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This trick is very useful for sampling PBR grayscale maps like <b>roughness</b>, <b>metalness</b> and <b>ambient occlusion</b> just once. 
        Instead of creating three different <string>float</string> variables and sampling them thrice, you can just do it once, by packing them 
        together into a single <string>float3</string> vector. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a code snippet showing how is it done:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
PS
{   
    // ...

    // Create 3 texture input slots that will be visible in Material Editor. 
    CreateInputTexture2D( Roughness, Linear, 8, "", "_rough", "Material,10/40", Default( 1 ) );
    CreateInputTexture2D( Metalness, Linear, 8, "", "_metal",  "Material,10/50", Default( 1 ) );
    CreateInputTexture2D( AmbientOcclusion, Linear, 8, "", "_rough", "Material,10/60", Default( 1 ) );

    // Create a single Texture2D with all three maps packed together.
    // s&box will generate single compiled texture map out of it, with each map 
    // put into corresponding channel as it's set in here. 
    Texture2D g_tRMA < Channel( R, Box( Roughness ), Linear ); Channel( G, Box( Metalness ), Linear ); Channel( B, Box( AmbientOcclusion ), Linear ); SrgbRead( false ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); >;
    
    // ...
    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0 
    {
        // ...
        Material mat = Material::Init();

        float3 rma = g_tRMA.Sample( g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords.xy );
        mat.Roughness = rma.r;
        mat.Metalness = rma.g;
        mat.AmbientOcclusion = rma.b;
        
        // ...
        return ShadingModelStandard::Shade( i, mat );
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        And this is how compiled texture (generated by s&box) looks like after you save the material, where roughness, metalness and 
        ambient occlusion maps are compiled into a single Texture2D object:
