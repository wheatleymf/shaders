        <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="Article">
    <p>
        If you are wondering what do things like <string>g_fl</string>, <string>Ws</string> or <string>Ts</string> mean: usually this is how some devs 
        indicate which type is expected, like for variables or functions. This isn't necessary by any means, you can give your 
        functions and variables any name. (although having consistent naming convention is nice if you're working in a team). 
    </p>

    <h2>List of Common Definitions</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>g_</string> prefix usually stands for <b>"global"</b>. Usually this is how devs indicate that data is accessible 
                from anywhere, like <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/global-variables-kSdlbnBNq8">global variables</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>_fl</string> prefix stands for <b>float</b>. It indicates that this is a single-component value specifically, not
                a vector float. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>_i</string> prefix stands for <b>int</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>_v</string> usually just stands for a <b>vector</b>, which can be float2, float3 or float4. Maybe int vector too.  
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>_mat</string> indicates that this is a matrix variable. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Os</string> suffix stands for <b>object space</b>. Before vertices are transformed into world-space/projection space coordinates,
                usually they are sent to shaders in object space coords first. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Ws</string> suffix stands for <b>world space</b>. Like world-space normals, world space pixel position, 
                anything that describes any data in world coordinates. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Ps</string> suffix is <b>projection space</b>. You could see this in vertex struct. Before finishing vertex shader, 
                you're expected to transform your vertices into <i>projection space</i>. So functions called something like
                <b>Position3WsToPs( ... );</b> means "convert float3 world-space position into projection space".
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Ss</string> suffix is <b>screen space</b>. PixelInput struct contains <string>i.vPositionSs</string>, which is essentially 
                UV for your current camera's viewport. Even if you're making a surface shader for your mesh, this viewport UV, unlike the rest 
                of your mesh, is actually in screen-space coordinates. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Ts</string> suffix is <b>tangent space</b>. Usually this is how you may want to name your tangent-space normal maps variables,
                that are not transformed into world space normals yet.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Automatic Variable Cleanup</h2>
    <p>
        Material Editor comes with a little handy feature: if you have variables that follow this naming convention, and they are also 
        exposed for editing by artists, any specific prefixes like <string>g_fl</string> will be automatically removed from the name 
        of this variable in material editor UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will also automatically format variable name into a readable format. For example, <string>g_vMyVectorWs</string> will be displayed 
        in Material Editor UI as <b>"My Vector"</b>.
    </p>
