        Hi. I'm working on a bunch of articles about shaders for absolute beginners, with obnoxious amount of details and explanations.
        My goal is that (hopefully) you should become more familiar with HLSL and s&box shaders specifically. Although some things about 
        shader still change, and some new stuff shows up sometimes, most of the material should stay up to date. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is probably not very useful if you're planning to go very deep into graphics programming. I imagine that this stuff will be 
        mainly useful for people like artists that want to make their stuff look even cooler in s&box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please keep in mind that this is a very early iteration of the entire page. There will be grammar and factual errors. There are probably 
        code snippets that are dumb or weird. I'm still learning, too, and anybody is welcome to help & contribute.
    </p>

    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone is welcome to contribute: article fixes, code improvements, article additions, and new courses/articles of your choice. 
        Currently it's just me (wheatleymf) who's taking care of this page, but I'm absolutely open for anyone to help grow this thing 
        into something more useful, readable and helpful. 
    </p>

    <h2>Beta!</h2>
    <p>
        This website is incomplete. There is still some functionality that I haven't implemented yet, and some articles weren't written 
        yet. I'm pretty sure it's still possible to break the entire JS script. Anyway, I'm sorry for any potential inconvenience! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Also feel free to suggest any ideas for new articles. If there are any questions you have, please let me know and I'll try to explain/cover 
        these subjects in new stuff, and extend existing articles. 
    </p>
