    <p>
        s&box comes with a little code library that has bunch of functions to generate few noises types and shapes. 
        This isn't an article explaining noises in general, but features that come with this library.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that some of these functions are utilized by shadergraph, however there's nothing stopping you from 
        using it in your code too. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Noises</h3>
    <p>
        Here's a list of all available functions within this library, and short description of what are they doing. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>FuzzyNoise()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value representing noise, visually very 
                similar to static TV noise. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>FuzzyNoise2D()</string> returns a <b>float2</b> value representing the same TV-static noise
                as function above, except it is two-dimensional now. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>FuzzyNoiseWithOffset()</string> returns a <b>float2</b> with the same 2D fuzzy noise, except you can offset 
                the values if it's necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>ValueNoise()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value representing a more traditional kind of noise, 
                using four fuzzy noise values from each corner of given UVs and then interpolating the values between. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Simplex2D()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value that represents <b>simplex noise</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>VoronoiNoise()</string> returns a <b>float</b> that represents <b>voronoi noise</b>. This function allows 
                adjusting angle and density through separate arguments. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Shapes</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>Checkboard()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value that represents a checkboard pattern, mapped onto 
                given UV coordinates. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Circle()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value that represents a circle shape, which will be drawn in the middle 
                of given UV coordinates, where circle size is defined by the second argument.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Ellipse()</string> does the same thing as function above, but just under a different function name. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Square()</string> returns a <b>float</b> value that represents a sqaure shape, which will be drawn in the middle 
                of given UV coordinates, where square size is defined by the second argument. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Rect()</string> has the same functionality as <string>Square</string>. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>UV Helpers</h3>
    <p>
        There's also bunch of helper functions for UV if you don't want to manage it yourself.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>TileUv</string> adjusts the UV scale. Values closer to 0 will make textures (that are sampled using this 
                UV value) appear larger, while smaller will make them appear smaller and repeated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>OffsetUv</string> will offset the UV in given direction. It takes offset value as a <b>float2</b> vector, 
                allowing to have control over offset on both UV axis. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>TileAndOffsetUv</string> does both tiling and offset like above, but combined in a single function. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>PolarCoordinates</string> returns <b>float2</b> value with given UV coordinates wrapped into 
                <b>polar</b> coordinate system. This can be later used as transformed UV for sampling texture, noises or anything else.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>PI Values</h3>
    <p>
        This library also defines following variations of <b>Pi</b> value:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>M_PI2</string>: double PI, <b>6.28318530717958647692</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>M_INVPI</string>: inverse PI, <b>0.31830988618379067154</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>M_INV2PI</string>: inverse double PI, <b>0.15915494309189533577</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this library is imported in your shader code, you should be able to reference these value definitions.
    </p>

    <h2>Noise Functions</h2>
    <p>
        Now let's properly review all available noise functions in-depth, and see how they affect the visuals. 
        For this article, I will be using a primitive unlit shader where noise function is directly returned as a final pixel. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to see how noise functions appear in your shader, this is the simplest way you can do it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = SomeKindofNoise( i.vTextureCoords.xy + g_flTime );
return float4( noise.xxx, 1 ); 
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Fuzzy Noise</h3>
    <p>
        Fuzzy Noise visually looks like static TV noise. It is one of the cheapest noises available in this code library, 
        but also visually primitive too; this isn't that kind of noise you saw in advanced shaders like water or clouds in the web. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
FuzzyNoise( float2 vUv, float2 vDot = float2(12.9898f, 78.233f) )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>vUv</string> are the UV values you should put into this noise. It will define how this noise will be mapped 
                on given surface. UV accuracy isn't very important for this type of noise because they're returning an unique 
                noise value per-pixel.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>vDot</string> are magic numbers (?) that are already defined, so you can pass only texture coordinates 
                to get this function working. Think of it as a <b>seed</b> for this noise, where different values result in generating 
                noise in a different pattern.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate fuzzy noise using meshes texture coordinates, do this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float fuzzy = FuzzyNoise( i.vTextureCoords.xy ); 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will generate a new fuzzy noise across the UVs. Keep in mind that passing single texture coords without animated 
        offset/scaling will result in noise texture appearing static, it won't be animated. If you want to make it appear animated, 
        you can pass <b>g_flTime</b> global variable into the <string>vDot</string> input.  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float fuzzy = FuzzyNoise( i.vTextureCoords.xy, g_flTime ); 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, this noise is so small, it basically generates noise per-pixel. Increasing the UV scale by multiplying 
        will not work here, but quantizing texture coords will work. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
i.vTextureCoords.xy = floor( 32 * i.vTextureCoords.xy ) / 32;
float noise = FuzzyNoise( i.vTextureCoords.xy + g_flTime );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Increase both values if you want to keep the noise in higher resolution. I am not sure if it's the best way 
        to do it personally, but in case you need pixelated fuzzy noise specifically, this should work. :-) 
    </p>

    <h3>2D Fuzzy Noise</h3>
    <p>
        You can also generate fuzzy noise in 2D space. It results the same type of noise, except wrapped in <b>float2</b> vector.
        It also generates second channel with a different <string>vDot</string> value, so it is visually different than first channel.  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 noise = FuzzyNoise2D( float2 UV );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Unlike <b>FuzzyNoise</b> function, you can't adjust <string>vDot</string> value for this function. 
    </p>

    <h3>Fuzzy Noise with Offset</h3>
    <p>
        It also returns 2D fuzzy noise, except noise values are multiplied by the offset, wrapped into sin/cos functions and corrected 
        within the <b>0 to 1</b> range:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 noise = FuzzyNoiseWithOffset( float2 UV, float offset );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is how function's code looks inside:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 noise = FuzzyNoise2D( vUv );
return float2(
    sin(noise.y * flOffset) * 0.5f + 0.5f,
    cos(noise.x * flOffset) * 0.5f + 0.5f
);
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        <string>* 0.5f + 0.5f</string> is required to clamp these sin/cos values within the <b>0 to 1</b> range because initially 
        these functions return values in <b>-1 to 1</b> range instead. In most cases, especially if color output depends on it,
        this is not preferred due to potential visual errors.   
    </info>
    <p>
        Any value can be used as an offset. If you add <b>g_flTime</b> as offset, then whole dynamic static noise starts to move around 
        in a much, much smoother fashion, compared to previous implementations. If you increase the speed for <b>g_flTime</b>, this will 
        also make this gradual noise move faster. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = FuzzyNoiseWithOffset( i.vTextureCoords.xy, g_flTime * 10 );
    </code></pre>

        <source src="/media/fuzzynosiewithoffset.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>

    <h3>Value Noise</h3>
    <p>
        Value noise is a relatively primitive type of noise that calculates cells across given UVs, "samples" fuzzy noise values 
        in 4 corners, calculates average noise for each cell and then interpolates it between each other. As a result, we get a really 
        simple noise. Returns <b>float</b> value. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It also has slightly higher instruction count. While this isn't a problem for modern hardware probably, just keep in mind that 
        more detailed noise generators are also utilizing more resources. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float ValueNoise( float2 uv )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This is how value noise looks like with texture coordinates as an input, multiplied by 10 for higher density:
    </p>
    <img src="/media/proc_valuenoise.png">

    <h3>2D Simplex Noise</h3>
    <p>
        Simplex noise is a gradient noise, which means that depending on input, your noise value smoothly goes higher and lower 
        in various spots, providing a significantly higher quality noise. Previous noise types mentioned above are definitely 
        cheaper performance-wise, however, depending on your situation, they may be not perfect or not suitable at all. Returns <b>float</b> value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float Simplex2D( float2 uv )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        It has a somewhat triangular shape, however it can be smoothed out if necessary by multiplying the value or iterating 
        with it anyhow else. 
        For example, this noise was used for the <article-ref link="pt10_displacement">Vertex Displacement</article-ref> article 
        as the vertex offset value in one of the samples. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/proc_simplex.png">

    <h3>Voronoi Noise</h3>
    <p>
        Voronoi noise, also known as <b>worley noise</b>, returns a <b>float</b> which represents the value at a given coordinate 
        that corresponds to the distance of the nearest seed, and seed itself is evenly distributed through the region. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float VoronoiNoise( float2 uv, float angleOffset, float density )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>uv</string> are the UV coordinates, as a <b>float2</b> vector,
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>angleOffset</string> adjusts the alignment of those "seed" points across the coordinates. This can be 
                used for animating the noise movement,
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>density</string> basically affects the scaling of this noise.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you pass time constant as an angle offset, this will smoothly animate the alignment of points in the noise. Greater 
        values for density will make the noise texture appear smaller, while lesser numbers will make it appear larger. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = VoronoiNoise( i.vTextureCoords.xy, g_flTime, 2 );
    </code></pre>
    <video controls autoplay loop>
        <source src="/media/proc_voronoi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <h2>Procedural Shapes</h2>
    <p>
        These functions generate realtime patterns and shapes according to given UVs. Most of these functions support adjusting the scale, 
        and you also can adjust UVs as you wish to change how these shapes/patterns are aligned on the surface.  
    </p>

    <h3>Checkerboard</h3>
    <p>
        Generates a checkerboard pattern on given surface, using UVs and defined frequency. Larger frequency number will increase 
        the tiling of this pattern. Frequency can be either <b>float</b> or <b>float2</b>, if you want to make frequency of tiles 
        non-uniform. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float Checkerboard( float2 Uv, float2 Frequency )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Here's an example of a checkboard that generates with frequency of 3 on axis X, and 10 on axis Y. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = Checkerboard( i.vTextureCoords.xy, float2( 3, 10 ) );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/proc_checkerboard.png">
    
    <h3>Circle and Ellipse</h3>
    <info>
        There are functions called <string>Circle</string> and <string>Ellipse</string>, however they both have the same 
        functionality. So feel free to use either of them.
    </info>
    <p>
        Draws a circle of a certain size at the middle of given UV coordinates.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float Circle( float2 uv, float size )
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>uv</string> - texture coordinates. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>size</string> - size of given circle. Value of <b>1</b> will draw the circle across the entire UV 
                from <b>[0,0] to [1,1]</b>. Value of <b>2</b> will draw the circle with size of double UV. Smaller values 
                will draw it without reaching the original UV bounds. <b>0.5</b> will be half of the UV. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This will draw a circle that fills 75% of given UV coordinates. Please keep in mind that this shape will rendered within 
        the <b>0-1</b> range, circle/square shapes using this implementation do not tile. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float shape = Circle( i.vTextureCoords.xy, 0.75 );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/proc_ellipse.png">
    <p>
        If you would like to offset the positioning of circle across the UV, you can just add/subtract values from texture
        coordinates. 
    </p>

    <h3>Square and Rect</h3>
    <info>
        There are functions called <string>Square</string> and <string>Rect</string>, however they both have the same 
        functionality. So feel free to use either of them.
    </info>
    <p>
        Draws a square shape on given UV coordinates. Uses same alignment rules as circle/ellipse function, also supports 
        adjusting the size of this shape. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float Square( float2 uv, float size)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This is will draw a square shape at the middle of UVs, with the size of 50% of those texture coordinates.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float shape = Square( i.vTextureCoords.xy, 0.5 );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/proc_square.png">

    <h2>Polar Coordinates</h2>
    <p>
        There's a helper function that converts texture coordinates into polar coordinate system. Here's an example with 
        simplex noise that is drawing using default UV <b>without</b> any manipulations:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = Simplex2D( i.vTextureCoords.xy );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/proc_simplex.png">
    <p>
        And this is how this noise looks like after after applying polar coordinates.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 PolarCoords = PolarCoordinates( i.vTextureCoords.xy );
float noise = Simplex2D( PolarCoords );
    </code></pre>
    <img src="/media/proc_simplex_polar.png">
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system">Polar coordinate system</a> wraps UV textures in a circle,
        with the center point being UV's <b>0,0</b> points. Coordinates end up getting "swirled" into this origin point.  
    </p>

    <h2>Some Tips</h2>
    <h3>World Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
        This is pretty known, but you can sample textures and noises using world-space coordinates. This allows attaching noises 
        to the world itself, while still applying it into the mesh surface. This makes it independent from any mesh transforms, 
        it can be moved around but without affecting how noise is wrapped around. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To get world-space coordinates in fragment shader, do this:  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 vPositionWs = i.vPositionWithOffsetWs + g_vCameraPositionWs;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        World-space coordinates may be too small without any adjustments. Dividing it by any value will increase the scaling. 
        So if you divide these coords by <b>512</b>, that would be essentially setting the UV scale to be tiled by 512x512 world units. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
vPositionWs /= 512;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        To sample along the X and Y axis world coordinates, grab XY component from this <string>vPositionWs</string> vector. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float noise = Simplex2D( vPositionWs.xy );
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        You can also use any other combination of coordinates if you'd like to sample the texture/noise along other 
        coordinates. For example, things like <string>.xz</string>, <string>.yz</string> would be all valid. However, 
        keep in mind that any of these combinations will result in one of the world axis rendering these textures in 
        a very distorted way. To properly wrap the texture along world coordinates without any skewing, you'll need 
        triplanar mapping. 
    </info>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that for some things like shapes world-space coordinates may not work, since shapes would always 
        render to world's absolute zero coordinates (unless you implement offset that sets the placement
        of that shape in desired world-space position). 
    </p>

    <h3>Using in Vertex Shader</h3>
    <p>
        Vertex shaders allow sampling textures inside of it. That applies to generating any sort of noise data too, 
        there are no limitations on calculating any sorts of information from vertex shader. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example from <article-ref link="pt10_displacement">Vertex Displacement</article-ref> article, where I am using 
        simplex 2D and world-space vertex position to deform vertices. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// g_flSwaySpeed, g_flNoiseScale and g_flDisplacementStrength are variables defined within that shader
float2 vPosWs = o.vPositionWs.xy / (g_flNoiseScale * 50);
float flNoise = Simplex2D( vPosWs + (g_flTime * g_flSwaySpeed) ) * g_flDisplacementStrength;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Also, you can still utilize texture coordinates from given mesh, this data is also available from vertex shader. 
    </p>
