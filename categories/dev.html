        This website is a bit chaotic, so I need some test playground to see if all styling and elements are displaying as intended.
        Reading this article isn't necessary for your learning. :-)

    <h2>Subheader</h2>
    <p>
        Subheaders <b>are usually followed by a bunch of text.</b> This is how nearly all articles are designed. Imagine how awkward would it be if all articles
        in the world would contain just subheaders, but nothing else afterwards? Sorry, I am just typing out nonsense.

    <warning>
        This is a warning block! It should warn you about some important changes to the API or it's quirks, or about impending doom of our humanity.
    </warning>
    <p>
        See this text above? Looks fucking scary. I hope nobody dies.
    </p>
    <info>
        This should mention something like a fun fact, little tip or just words of wisdom. But knowing myself, it'll be some useless details.
    </info>
    <p>Wow! This was helpful bit of information. It helped me understanding the context. Now I know more about this world.</p>

        Thing above was a code example. Some articles will provide some snippets, yeah, isn't that awesome? Although keep in mind that some parts of it
        are referencing HLSL code outside of the main shader file, so don't get confused about it :-)
