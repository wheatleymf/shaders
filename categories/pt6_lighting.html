    <p>
        In this article we're going to make a new shader. Grab your unlit shader and gut out almost everything: clean out contents in FEATURES, 
        code in MainPs, everything outside of MainPs in fragment shader. We're starting almost from scratch because converting unlit shader 
        would take more time and redundant. You're going to use same techniques to build a lit shader. 
    </p>
    <p>
        s&box comes with a built-in standard shading model, which handles everything we need to get a good looking 
        <a href="https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory">PBR lighting</a>. It reads the information from <string>PixelInput</string>
        and the <string>Material</string> object. Material consists of properties like albedo, normal, roughness, metalness, ambient
        occlusion, etc... and these properties are used to calculate the lighting. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt6_pipeline.png">    
    <p>
        This image shows all required texture maps for PBR rendering. I recommend checking out the linked article about PBR since it shows 
        quite well how various texture maps affect the surface visuals. Let's start with adding all texture inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>Texture Inputs</h2>
    <p>
        Add texture inputs for <b>albedo map</b>, <b>normal map</b>, <b>roughness map</b>, <b>metalness map</b>, <b>ambient occlusion</b>,
        and <b>tint mask</b> inside the fragment shader, <i>outside</i> of <string>MainPs</string>. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#define CUSTOM_MATERIAL_INPUTS 
#include "common/pixel.hlsl"

//
// Prepare inputs for all textures
//
CreateInputTexture2D( Color, 			Srgb, 	8, "", "_color", "Material,10/Albedo Map,10/10", Default3( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ) );						
CreateInputTexture2D( ColorTintMask, 	Linear, 8, "", "_tint", "Material,10/Albedo Map,10/20", Default( 1 ) );						
CreateInputTexture2D( Normal, 			Linear, 8, "NormalizeNormals", "_normal", "Material,10/Normal Maps,10/30", Default3( 0.5, 0.5, 1.0 ) );		
CreateInputTexture2D( Roughness, 		Linear, 8, "", "_rough", "Material,10/Roughness,10/40", Default( 1 ) );											
CreateInputTexture2D( Metalness, 		Linear, 8, "", "_metal",  "Material,10/Metalness,10/50", Default( 0 ) );
CreateInputTexture2D( AmbientOcclusion, Linear, 8, "", "_ao",  "Material,10/Ambient Occlusion,10/60", Default( 1 ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This will create input slots for all necessary textures used by PBR. As you can see, only color map and normals are <string>float3</string>,
        since they're in RGB format. But the only colored texture that uses sRGB color space is a <b>Color</b> slot. This is necessary to ensure that 
        albedo map appears the same as in other image editing/preview software.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Normal maps, despite being a colored map too, don't have to be processed in sRGB color space. Technically, it's a packed texture consisting 
        of three unique maps, so for proper precision they must be handled in linear color space. This also applied to nearly all other grayscale maps, 
        like masks and other textures that represent data instead of color. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, let's create Texture2D's for these texture. Besides of being able to sample these textures later in <string>MainPs</string> function, 
        by declaring these textures we signal to s&box how these textures must be packed in compiled textures. More explanations below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// 
// Create Texture2D for all basic inputs
// Albedo (3 channels) and tint mask (1 ch) go to ColorMap texture. (float4 in total)
// Normal map (3 channels) is stored separately. (float3 as a result)
// Roughness/Metalness/AO (1 channel each) are stored together in a single texture (float3 in total) 
//
Texture2D ColorMap  < Channel( RGB, Box( Color ), Srgb ); Channel( A, Box( ColorTintMask ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
Texture2D NormalMap < Channel( RGB, Box( Normal ), Linear ); OutputFormat( DXT5 ); SrgbRead( false ); >; 
Texture2D g_tRma    < Channel( R, Box( Roughness), Linear ); Channel( G, Box( Metalness ), Linear); Channel( B, Box( AmbientOcclusion ), Linear ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead ( false ); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Instead of having to create new Texture2D for every texture input slot, you can pack several input slots into appropriate channels 
        of a single Texture2D. This allows significantly reducing amount of compiled texture files, and you'll have to 
        sample less textures in the actual fragment shader. 
    </p>
    <h3>Side notes: Texture packing</h3>
    <p>
        This is especially beneficial for amount of textures s&box will have to compile for every material that uses your shader.
        You probably know this already, but your game ships not with the source texture files you add in your material folder. 
        Published s&box game comes with compiled textures: they're automatically generated when you save the material in the editor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These compiled textures are stored in the s&box-specific file format, compressed and packed. Using Texture2D annotations you control 
        which compression method is applied, and how exactly they're packed. Properly packed textures can slightly reduce total size of your material.
    </p>
    <img src="/media/texturepacking.png">

    <h2>Sampling Textures</h2>
    <p>
        Before proceeding, let's reinstate texture scroll, scale and tint variables from the unlit shader. This was done as a part of 
        article "Textures and Variables". 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Texture scale & offset from the previous unlit shader
int2    TextureScrollDirection < UiType( Slider ); Range2( -1, -1, 1, 1 ); Default2( 0, 0 ); UiGroup( "Settings,20/Scroll,20/10" ); >;
float2  TextureScrollSpeed < UiType( Slider ); Range2( 0, 0, 4, 4 ); Default2( 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "Settings,20/Scroll,20/20" ); >;
float   TextureScale < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 5 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Settings,20/Scale,20/30" ); >;
float3  TextureTint < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 1, 1 ); UiGroup( "Settings,20/Texture Tint,20/40" ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        And now let's move to <string>MainPs</string> block. Let's bring back the UV functionality that allows changing texture scale, 
        scrolling speed and direction. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 uv = i.vTextureCoords.xy * TextureScale;
uv += g_flTime * TextureScrollSpeed * TextureScrollDirection;   
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        And now let's sample all of the textures you have defined in the fragment shader. Don't forget: any texture inputs that are initialized 
        but never used in the actual shader code, won't show up in the material editor. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float4 albedo = ColorMap.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgba;
float3 normal = DecodeNormal( NormalMap.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgb );
float3 rma = g_tRma.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgb;
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Normal Decoding</h2>
    <p>
        You have probably noticed a new function, <string>DecodeNormal()</string>. What is it for? Before your normal map texture 
        can be used in the shader, it must be decoded into proper format first: don't forget that color maps are working in <b>[0-1]</b>
        range, while normal maps are set in <b>[ -1 - 1]</b> range. TBH there are probably some other things that this function does. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Normal map textures always must be decoded before using them for (almost) all kinds of operations. For the rest of textures, 
        everything is done in a simple manner. Since <string>ColorMap</string> contains four channels, it will be sampled into 
        <string>float4</string> vector. Normals and Roughness-Metalness-AO pack use three channels, so it'll be float3 for both of them. 
    </p>

    <h3>Transforming Normals to World Space</h3>
    <p>
        Another necessary thing we must do before continuing, is <b>transforming normals to world space</b>. This is necessary to get 
        normal shading on your model working correctly. Luckily, s&box has a built-in helper function for this too, and all you need to do 
        is this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Don't forget to decode your normal map before doing this!
float3 NormalTransformed = TransformNormal( normal, i.vNormalWs, i.vTangentUWs, i.vTangentVWs );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This is the final normal map data you'll be passing into the shading model. This must be done <i>after</i> decoding the normal map texture.
        If you're familiar with HLSL syntax, you're free to do this in a more compact way, creating a new separate variable isn't necessary.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides of providing correct normal data for the shading model, world-space normals are useful for a few tricks and other things. 
        While these effects won't be a subject of this article, I'll probably show them sometime later in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But where do all these texture go after all this? This is where everything goes in a special <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/material-gVbbmBfLmp">Material class</a>. 
        It contains all necessary slots required for PBR, and s&box default shading model relies on this class to pass all textures 
        and other important data. 
    </p>

    <h2>Material Class</h2>
    <p>
        I recommend looking up the definition of a Material class mentioned on the docs page above, it shows all available slots you can 
        fill out. There are two main functions you can use to properly initialize a new Material class:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>Material::From( PixelInput i )</string> will automatically process all required texture inputs and expose them 
                to Material Editor for you.  
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Material::Init()</string> will create a new <b>empty</b> Material class. This does not generate any input slots 
                or anything else, you must create them and fill out manually, providing full control over what goes into your shaders. 
                <b>This is what we will use here.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Material class comes as a part of the <string>common/pixel.hlsl</string> file, that you always must include at the beginning 
        of your fragment shader block. Using this class is necessary if you're working with the standard shading model, although this 
        class can be easily adapted for any other custom lighting models if you'd like. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Below all other code with UV manipulations and texture sampling, add this line:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Material mat = Material::Init();
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now, you can fill out all available slots. In our case, this will look like this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Re-implements albedo tint from previous unlit shader
mat.Albedo = lerp( albedo.rgb, albedo.rgb * TextureTint, albedo.a );
mat.Normal = NormalTransformed;
mat.Roughness = rma.r;
mat.Metalness = rma.g;
mat.AmbientOcclusion = rma.b;
mat.TintMask = albedo.a;
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        To pick specific texture from these "packed" vectors, just select the corresponding channel that you specified in your 
        Texture2D declarations. Here, roughness map is on red channel, metalness is on green, and ambient occlusion in on blue. 
        Tint mask is stored along with a color map as a 4th channel, alpha.      
    </p>
    <p>
        That's it, your material object is now complete. There are other slots you can setup, but usually you don't need to worry about this. 
        Last thing you have to do is, pass this material and your PixelInput struct into the standard shading model.
    </p>

    <h2>Passing to Shading Model</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
return ShadingModelStandard::Shade( i, mat );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <string>ShadingModelStandard</string> is a class, although the only function you will probably interact with, is <string>Shade( i, mat )</string>.
        We are returning this method because it brings back the final, shaded pixel of <string>float4</string> type. Don't forget, last component 
        represents opacity, but since this shader currently does not support transparency, it remains unused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go to Material Editor and try creating a new material with your lit shader. Fill out the texture input and see how does it look like!
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt6_litshader.png">
    <p>
        At this point, you can consider your lit shader to be complete. It supports all base PBR maps and renders correctly. However,
        it would be wrong to stop here; let's add some more features! 
    </p>

    <h2>Extra #1: Adding Emission</h2>
    <p>
        Emission map is basically a colored texture map that makes your material appear lit even in dark/shaded areas. This is useful for adding fake lighting onto props, 
        or some other effects. Just like albedo, emission map is expected to be read in sRGB color space. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this feature is usually not required for most materials, let's wrap it behind a static combo first. If you haven't checked out 
        the article that explains combos, please read it first. In <string>FEATURES</string> block, above the features include, add a new line 
        defining emission feature:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Feature( F_EMISSION, 0..1, "Extra Features" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then go back to the fragment shader, and at the top of the code, add a definition for new static combo called <string>S_EMISSION</string>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
StaticCombo( S_EMISSION, F_EMISSION, Sys( ALL ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now let's write combo-specific code. Combo-specific combo starts with <string>#if ( CONDITION )</string> and end with 
        <string>#endif</string>. Inside of it, make a new texture input slot for the emission map, set to be read in sRGB color space, 
        then make a new Texture2D declaration. For some extra control, add a new float variable that affects the intensity of this emission map.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#if ( S_EMISSION )
    CreateInputTexture2D( Emission, Srgb, 8, "", "_em", "Material,10/Emission,10/70", Default3( 0, 0, 0 ) );
    Texture2D EmissionMap < Channel( RGB, Box( Emission), Srgb ); OutputFormat( BC7 ); SrgbRead( true ); >;

    float g_flEmissionStrength < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 8 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup( "Material,10/Emission,10/71"); >;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Great, all you have to do now is go to <string>MainPs</string> and add another combo code which will sample the emission map, 
        multiply it by your new emission strength variable, and then store it into material object's "Emission" slot. You can implement this 
        anywhere in the code after the initialization of your material object. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
#if ( S_EMISSION )
    mat.Emission = EmissionMap.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgb * g_flEmissionStrength;
#endif
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Done! Now, once you compile this shader, new feature will show up at the side bar of Material Editor. Turn it on, and emission input slot 
        will appear. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt6_emission.png">

    <h2>Extra #2: Normal Map Intensity</h2>
    <p>
        Although not necessary, but you can control the intensity of a normal map in your shader. This is fairly easy to do, and should give slghtly more 
        control for artist that will use your shader.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, add a new <string>float</string> variable that will control the intensity of your normal map. You can add it anywhere you'd like. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float g_flNormalIntensity < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 3 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup("Material,10/Normal Map,10/31"); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then inside the <string>MainPs</string> block, you need to multiply <i>decoded</i> normal map's <b>red</b> and <b>green</b> channel 
        components by this new variable. We're explicitly updating only two channels because this is what represent actual "bumps" in the normal 
        map in tangent-space. You shouldn't mess with blue channel as it will break the visuals. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// This must be done AFTER decoding, but BEFORE transforming!
normal.rg *= g_flNormalIntensity;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As a result, you can now adjust how "intense" normal map appears. Value reaching zero will make normal map appear flatter, 
        while values above 1 will make it appear significantly bumpier. Keep in mind that excessively large values will likely look ugly, 
        so be careful with this!
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt6_normalstrength.png">

    <p>
        That's it for now! In the future, I may update this article with some new extra features, but this stuff should be enough for now. 
        In next article we'll add opacity to this shader, explore alpha test and some other specifics.
