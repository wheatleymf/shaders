        <b>Screen-space fog</b> is one of the simplest way to implement fog in your game. It utilizes <b>depth buffer</b> to read the 
        screen depth and calculate fog based on this data. In this article, you'll create screenspace fog with ability to adjust 
        density and change fog color. 
    </p>
    <h2>Set up a Shader</h2>
    <p>
        Add <string>MODES</string> section with <b>VrForward()</b> added. You'll also need to add <string>COMMON</string> and include 
        a HLSL file <b>"postprocess/shared.hlsl"</b>. It will add bunch of core <string>fxc</string> files that carry most global variables 
        and other properties that will be used in this shader.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
MODES
{
    VrForward();
}

COMMON
{
    #include "postprocess/shared.hlsl"
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Vertex and Pixel structs</h3>
    <p>
        Let's add VertexInput and PixelInput structs. This time, it can be even more primitive: in fragment shader you'll only need 
        screen-space coordinates, so let's add <string>vPositionOs</string> to vertex struct and <string>vPositionSs</string> to 
        pixel struct.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
struct VertexInput
{
    float3 vPositionOs : POSITION;
};

struct PixelInput
{
    float4 vPositionSs : SV_Position;
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that any property with a semantic of <string>SV_Position</string> must be a float4. 
    </p>

    <h3>Vertex Shader</h3>
    <p>
        In vertex shader, (<string>VS</string> section), lets just create a new empty <string>PixelInput</string> object and put 
        data from vertex input's <b>vPositionOs</b> into pixel input's <string>vPositionSs</string>. Since object-space position is 
        a vector with only three components, it must be put into <string>float4(...)</string> function. Fourth component is viewport 
        scale for this shader I believe...  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
VS
{
    PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
    {
        PixelInput o;
        o.vPositionSs = float4( i.vPositionOs.xyz, 1.0f );

        return o;
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Pixel Shader Variables</h3>
    <p>
        Now for fragment shader, make a new block <string>PS</string>. You need to include a few files, create Texture2D with 
        an attribute for the color buffer, define a new sampler state, and define the variable for C# component.   
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PS
{
    #include "postprocess/common.hlsl"
    #include "common/classes/Depth.hlsl"

    float3 fogColor < Attribute( "Color" ); >;
    float fogEnd < Attribute( "FogEndDistance" ); Default( 1250 ); >;
    float fogDensity < Attribute( "FogDensity" ); Default( 0.5 ); >;
    
    CreateTexture2D( g_tColorBuffer ) < Attribute( "ColorBuffer" ); SrgbRead( true ); >;
    SamplerState sLinear < Filter( Linear ); >;

    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
    { 		
        // ... 
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Wow, what is <string>Depth.hlsl</string>? This is HLSL file that defines a very useful <a href=https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/depth-TeFIlRYujJ">Depth class</a>. It has it's own texture input 
        for the depth buffer, which is why you don't have to manually pass depth into your post-processing shader. Instead of having to normalize 
        and linearize depth buffer values yourself, depth class already comes with a bunch of functions that do it for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You're already familiar with making a new Texture2D with an attribute. <string>fogColor</string> will read the values from any 
        C# data that is passed with a name of "Color". In C# component, color is represented by the Color class which consits of four 
        channels, but in this case you'll only need RGB, so it's a float3. <string>fogEnd</string> will set the "end" point for the fog 
        where it will go fully visible. <string>fogDensity</string> will adjust the length of fog's gradient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You also need to define your own sampler state. None of the included common post-processing files contain
        <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/sampler-states-LlJc7ymJkq#h-common-samplers">common sampler states</a>. 
        This is very easy though, just make a new sampler state with filter set to <b>Linear</b>. Nothing else is required.  
    </p>

    <h3>Pixel Shader function</h3>
    <p>
        First, sample the color buffer and store it in the <string>float3</string> variable. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 ColorBuffer = g_tColorBuffer.Sample( sLinear, i.vPositionSs.xy / g_vViewportSize.xy ).rgb;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Since you're not using texture coordinates in this shader, screen-space position must be divided <string>g_vViewportSize.xy</string>,
        which holds the size of your current viewport. Next step is getting the normalized depth buffer value for given pixel. 
        Using functions from HLSL classes is done in the following format: <string>ClassName::Function(...)</string>. 
        In this, it will be <b>Depth::GetLinear( ... )</b>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float flLinear = Depth::GetLinear( i.vPositionSs.xy );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Using <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/depth-TeFIlRYujJ#h-depthlinearize-float-d">linear</a> depth buffer value is perfect in this case. This allows easily building a much nicer fog. 
        Using raw/normalized depth data would be more annoying to work with, because by default depth buffer prioritizes 
        more precision up close, and gets abruptly dark and less precise further away. Linearized depth data makes it easier, 
        since it adjusts the depth value to be a properly linear 0-1 range, with ability to clamp the "end" point in world-space units.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, let's make a new variable out of <string>fogColor</string>, because color value sent from 
        C# as an attribute must be converted from sRGB to linear color space so it doesn't look off in your shader:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 _fogColor = SrgbGammaToLinear( fogColor.rgb );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now, let's make a new variable that will handle the lerp between frame buffer and fog. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 fogBlend = lerp( _fogColor, ColorBuffer, smoothstep( 0, fogDensity, 1 - flLinear / fogEnd ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You're probably familiar with lerp function already, but let me explain what's going on in the third argument. 
        First, there's <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/?search=smoothstep">smoothstep</a> function - this is a native 
        HLSL function, check it out. Inside of it, first we're diving linear depth value by distance, in world-space units. 
        This makes sure that depth buffer is "stretched" across from camera to given end distance. Then, <string>flLinear / fogEnd</string>
        is substracted from <string>1</string>. This will "invert" the value. For values within [0-1] range, you can do simple
        <string>value = 1 - value</string> to invert it.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <string>fogDensity</string> as smoothstep's "max" value will control how dense this fog is. By default, gradient length may be 
        a bit too long for your preference, so hooking up this attribute allows defining how long this gradient is. 1 will make it 
        very long, while 0 will make this gradient disappear altogether.  
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, this blended color variable is returned as a final pixel: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
return float4( fogBlend, 1 );        
    </code></pre>
    
    <h2>Fog Component</h2>
    <p>
        Make a new component, give it any name. Make sure it inherits from <string>PostProcess</string> component. Camera component 
        will be access from it. Add variables for <b>fog color</b>, <b>fog density</b>, and <b>fog end distance</b>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
[Property][Description("Specifies the distance where fog gets fully visible, in world units")] 
public float EndDistance { get; set; } = 1250.0f;
	
[Property][Range( 0, 1 )][Description("Defines the length between start and end of the fog gradient")]
public float FogDensity { get; set; } = 0.5f;
	
[Property]
public Color Color { get; set; }

private IDisposable hook;
private RenderAttributes attributes = new();
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Just like with the previous post-processing effect, add <string>OnEnabled()</string> and <string>OnDisabled()</string> 
        overrides, so render hook gets properly disposed if this component gets disabled. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
protected override void OnEnabled()
{
    hook?.Dispose();
    hook = Camera.AddHookAfterTransparent( "RenderFog", -1, Render );
}

protected override void OnDisabled()
{
    hook?.Dispose();
    hook = null;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The last argument in "AddHookAfterTransparent" points onto the function that will handle all actual rendering and blitting 
        the post-processing shader. Let's implement it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
public void Render( SceneCamera camera )
{
    var material = Material.FromShader( "shaders/screenspace_fog.shader" );
		
    attributes.Set( "FogEndDistance", EndDistance );
    attributes.Set( "Color", Color );
    attributes.Set( "FogDensity", FogDensity);

    Graphics.GrabFrameTexture( "ColorBuffer", attributes );
    Graphics.Blit( material, attributes );
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        First, we're creating a new material at runtime from your new screenspace fog shader. Then, we throw all component properties 
        into render attributes so they can be read from the shader. Also we send current frame texture into it. At last, blit it using 
        the given material and render attributes.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Now try setting up the properties in your new component! This shader should work from editor too, without having to go into 
        play mode and see if any changes were made to the camera.
