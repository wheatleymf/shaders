        If you'd like to contribute and submit your own article, (or if you'd like to edit any existing ones) you will have 
        to deal with abysmally dogshit backend that I've made for the website. This page will show the workflow when adding new pages. 
        I am really sorry that everything is glued with a ducttape like that, in the future I hope to gradually build something better.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Adding Pages</h2>
    <p>
        I am very sorry that this works so bad. Maybe in the future it'll be properly automated. 
    </p>
    <h3>Create a New HTML Page</h3>
    <p>
        First, create a new <string>.html</string> file in <b>/categories</b> directory. Give it any name you'd like. This file name 
        will be later used to be referenced in the left bar navigation list. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside of it, add the following code. This will create the layout for the page heading, that includes current category,
        article name and article icon. To set the icon, pick anything you want from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Google Fonts</a> and 
        copy the icon's name.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;div class=&quot;ArticleHeader&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;div class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;material-symbols-sharp&quot;&gt;insert_icon_name_here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;category name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Article name!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Then, create a new <string>div</string> element with a class <string>Article</string>. It just makes sure that all your text (and other content)
        is properly aligned with the layout design. This is where you will write your entire article.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding into Navigation</h3>
    <p>
        You have to manually insert this article into the navigation. It is located in <string>index.html</string>. Pick an appropriate category, and insert following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;a category=&quot;YOUR_ARTICLE_HTML_NAME&quot; onclick=&quot;DisplayCategory(&#39;YOUR_ARTICLE_HTML_NAME&#39;)&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;material-symbols-sharp&quot;&gt;INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE&lt;/span&gt; Article's name 
&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        If you're creating a new category, you have to insert it in the list as well. If you have just one article to submit, it's probably 
        not worth dedicating a new category for it yet. This will be figured out in the pull request. 
    </info>
    <p>
        Most important thing here is making sure that it refers the correct HTML page name in <string>YOUR_ARTICLE_HTML_NAME</string>.
        If you do something wrong, this page will not load properly. 
    </p>

    <h2>Page Markdown</h2>
    <p>
        For the most part, all articles are being edited as usual HTML pages. For links you're using <string>a</string> tag, 
        for images <string>img</string>, etc... But there are also few special tags with custom styling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All paragraphs are split between <string>P</string> tags. Most special tags require to be placed outside of these paragraphs. 
    </p>
    <h3>Warning and Info blocks</h3>
    <p>
        If you want to add a fancy, noticeable warning or note in your article, you can use tags <string>warning</string> and <string>info</string>.
        They're not inline, so put them outside of paragraph sections. This is how they will look like:
    </p>
    <warning>
        This is a warning! You may tell here about something really-really important, like incoming API changes, compatibility issues, 
        or anything else that is really worth reader's attention.
    </warning>
    <info>
        This one can contain any side notes, recommendations or tips! Did you know that Small Fish has released best s&box game 
        in March 2024, called <b>My Summer Cottage</b>?
    </info>

    <h3>Code Blocks</h3>
    <p>
        This website uses just one external library, it is <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>. It allows to add 
        fancy code preview for HLSL and other things. If you want to add a HLSL code snippet in your article, this is how you do it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hlsl&quot;&gt;
float farts = Ass.Sample( g_sAniso, i.vTextureCoords.xy );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        It's using custom HLSL highligher, I've tried to shove bunch of s&box specific things into it for better readability. I believe 
        it also supports number of other languages by default, like HTML, JS and few other things - but I don't think it will be useful here. 
        I may disable this in the future. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Variable Names</h3>
    <p>
        If you want to give fancy styling to things like variable names (example: <string>o.vPositionOs.xyz</string>), you can 
        use <string>string</string> tag. Unlike other special tags, this one is <b>inline</b> - so you can insert it inside of paragraphs, 
        and even warning/info blocks too. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;This is an example!&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Headings and Subheadings</h3>
    <p>
        They're marked using <string>h2</string> and <string>h3</string>. They have special feature: when you add them onto your page, 
        local JS script will automatically populate the list of available headings on this page, located on right side of the page. 
        When you click on them, you will be automatically redirect to that section of the article. This side panel also highlights 
        which section of the page you're currently reading. 
    </p>
    <warning>
        This panel is visible only if your browser viewport width is larger than 1800px. On smaller viewports it will be hidden.
    </warning>
    
    <h2>Testing Locally</h2>
    <p>
        Please make sure to test your changes locally before submitting them to GitHub. This should be trivial: you will need 
        <b>Visual Studio Code</b> and <b>Live Server</b> extension. Open <string>index.html</string> and click on the 
        <b>Go Live</b> button - it should be in bottom right corner, unless your VSCode has different UI layout. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When making changes to any pages, they will be automatically reloaded. JS and CSS changes are also automatically updated once 
        you save the file. Functionally wise, local instance of this website should work just like on the live website. 
    </p>
