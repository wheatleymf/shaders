            <b>IN THIS ARTICLE: </b> Understanding the anatomy of s&box shaders, figuring out vertex and pixel structs, how do floats work, creating first unlit shader

    <info>
        If you want to skip whole "figuring out the shader anatomy" part, you can use s&box editor to create a new shader file using a preset. 
        If you want to learn more about the file anatomy step by step, feel free to follow this part. 
    </info>

    <p>
        It is time to create our first shader! Lets start with something very simple: an <b>unlit shader</b>. What is an unlit shader? This usually 
        implies a shader that isn't affected by light or shading. It returns color with exact colors that shader had. 
    </p>

    <h3>Creating a new file</h3>
    <p>
        Lets create a new blank text file. Give it a <string>.shader</string> file extension, and throw it <string>shaders</string> folder
        inside of your s&box project. At the moment of writing this article you can create a new template shader right in s&box, but for the sake
        of a better article's flow and explaining every shader bit step by step, lets create it from scratch. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All of your <string>.shader</string> files are compiled by s&box <i>automatically</i>. Whenever there's an update in your shader file, 
        s&box will catch and attempt to compile it. The only exception are custom <string>.hlsl</string> files referenced in your shader
        as an <string>#include</string>, but they are optional and we don't need to make them right now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Shader compiler notifications are logged in your s&box editor console. If there are any errors, they will be displayed there.
    </p>

    <h2>Sections & Shader Anatomy</h2>
    <p>
        All shaders have a specific internal structure, and each has it's own purpose. Let me show how this structure generally looks like
        in an average shader. Don't copy it just yet, lets implement each section by ourselves.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// Shader structure, as of November 2024

// FEATURES block allows implementing options that you can click in left bar
// of the Material Editor. Features can be used for controlling static combos.
FEATURES
{
    // ...
}

// MODES implements shader modes. They define ways your shader will render
// under different passes or conditions. 
// https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/modes-SFu3UxPnhm
MODES 
{
    // This is a main rendering mode. You may want to always include it. 
    VrForward();
    // ...
}

// COMMON block allows defining variables and other data that you can access
// from anywhere, like from both vertex and fragment shader. 
COMMON
{
    // ...
}

// In this area you can define any structs, or other stuff. 
// You may want to define vertex and pixel input structs here.
...

// VS is a Vertex Shader. This block is your vertex shader.
// Main function of vertex shader is MainVs().
VS
{
    // ...
}

// PS is a Pixel Shader (fragment shader).
// This is a final shader stage and that's where you manipulate the color. 
// Main function of fragment shader is MainPs(), and it returns float4.
PS
{
    // ...
}   
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        If you looked up the code from some older s&box shaders, you probably noticed that they have a <string>HEADER</string> block right at the top.
        It is not necessary for your shader, and as of now, none of the information entered there is visible inside the engine.
        Feel free to ignore it.
    </info>

    <h3>FEATURES block</h3>
    <p>
        FEATURES allows implementing special options for your shader that you can disable/enable via Material Editor in the left bar.
        Generally features are needed for defining special <b>shader variants</b>, features variable value are used by <b>static combos</b>.
        We'll mess around with static combos and see how are they working later.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, lets implement the bare minimum. We need to include a core HLSL file which contains all built-in options, without these 
        our shader won't compile, for a whatever reason. Add this into your new shader file:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
FEATURES
{
    #include "common/features.hlsl"
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        If you're wondering what are we including, this <string>#include</string> will add features like "Do not cast shadows", "Render backfaces",
        as well as some other core features. <b>Texture Filtering</b> and <b>Additive Blend</b> won't work out of the box, which is awkward.
    </p>

    <h3>MODES block</h3>
    <p>
        Lets add MODES block. This block defines how our shader is handled in different passes. 
        For now, we need only <string>VrForward()</string>.
        You can see all available modes on s&box documentation page <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/modes-SFu3UxPnhm">here</a>. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>VrForward()</string> is a standard rendering mode. This is where all primary rendering happens, your shader won't 
                compile without this mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>Depth()</string> will make shader write to depth. This is necessary for shadow rendering and few other render 
                things like ambient occlusion, and anything else what relies on depth map. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>ToolsVis( S_MODE_TOOLS_VIS )</string> is <b>DEPRECATED</b>, but you may see it in some older shader files. As of now, 
                it's been deprecated and you don't have to include it anymore. I'll mentioned it here, just in case. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
MODES
{
	VrForward();
    Depth();
}            
    </code></pre>
    <warning>
        <string>Depth()</string> will be replaced with <string>DepthNormal()</string> in the near future. I don't know if old shaders
        will continue working, but you'll definitely need to replace it with a new method when it's out. It should bring support for G-buffer,
        which is a nice addition. 
    </warning>

    <h3>COMMON block</h3>
    <p>
        Next up is a COMMON block. All data and variables defined here <b>will be accessible from any shader stage</b>. By default, if you declare 
        a variable (or add a texture input) inside the vertex shader, you won't be able to access it from a fragment shader. But if you add 
        texture input/variable definitions inside the COMMON block, you will be able to access them from both vertex and fragment shader.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since you don't need to add anything that requires access from multiple shader stage yet, lets just include a core HLSL file that automatically
        imports all necessary stuff to get our shader compiling and move forward.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
COMMON
{
	#include "common/shared.hlsl"
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Structs</h2>
    <h3>Vertex Shader Input Struct</h3>
    <p> 
        Before you can use it to build and render your mesh with this new shader, this data must be
        sorted into an appropriate struct, with correctly set up <b><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics">semantics</a></b>. Luckily, s&box comes with pre-built vertex and pixel input structs,
        which means we don't have to set up any of these by ourselves. (you can always do it from scratch if you want to, but for now lets 
        stick with what s&box offers to us!)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>What is inside the vertex shader input struct?</b> Mesh vertices are represented by following data: <i>object space vertex position</i>,
            <i>texture coordinates</i>, and <i>object space normals</i>. Built-in <string>VertexInput</string> also comes with some additional stuff, that
            can help with instancing, skinning and a few other optional features.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Why do you need it?</b> This data is required
            by vertex shader to perform a number of operations, like transforming vertices into the projection space, calculating mesh tangents,
            geometrical normals, and fill out other data that will be later utilized in fragment (pixel) shader.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To add built-in <string>VertexInput</string> struct, just do this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
struct VertexInput
{
	#include "common/vertexinput.hlsl"
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Perfect! When you reference this struct in vertex shader, it'll automatically read the struct data from included .hlsl file.
        If you want to read more about vertex and pixel structs, s&box docs have a <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/default-vertex-and-pixel-shader-inputs-WAuOKVmkZ5">dedicated page for them</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Pixel Shader Input Struct</h3>
    <p>
        Let's do the same thing as with vertex struct. Use the built-in struct, it will be more than enough for us.
        When vertex shader finishes transforming and manipulating all vertex things, it returns a <string>PixelInput</string> object. This object
        is then used by fragment shader as a source of data to work with. This is where you are going to grab all things from: texture coordinates,
        pixel position, viewport UV, mesh geometry normals, etc.. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Both structs are utilized by s&box default shading model, so nearly all s&box shaders you will find online are utilizing these two 
        default structs. This is pretty convenient as it contains almost everything you need.  
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
struct PixelInput
{
	#include "common/pixelinput.hlsl"
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        And now all base data is included! Next step is adding a vertex shader.
    </p>

    <h2>Vertex Shader</h2>
    <p>
        As I've mentioned a few times in this article, vertex shader grabs the structured mesh data and does bunch of manipulations.
        Generally, this is where you may want to calculate geometry 
        normals, and transform vertex position into the projection space. Optionally, this is where you can also manipulate vertex 
        positions, which will affect the shape of a mesh. 
        When it's all done, vertex shader returns an object with all transformed data that is later used by fragment shader.
    </p>
    <h3>Processing Vertices</h3>
    <p>
        s&box has two main vertex helper functions that handle all these routine operations automatically, which means you don't need to worry about 
        instancing and setting up projection space yourself. These functions are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>ProcessVertex( VertexInput i )</string> - grabs the vertex shader input data and does most basic stuff for you:
                set up instancing and skinning, and then calculate vertex position in world space with geometry normals and tangents.
                This function takes <string>VertexInput</string> vertex and returns a new vertex with a type of <string>PixelInput</string>.
                <br><br>
                You can use data from object this function returns to do any sorts of manipulations: vertex displacement, normal/UV manipulations, 
                and anything else you'd like.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>FinalizeVertex( PixelInput o )</string> - before returning the vertex, it's position must be converted into the 
                projection space. This is what FinalizeVertex does.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These vertex helpes are documented on the <a href="https://docs.facepunch.com/s/sbox-dev/doc/vertex-helpers-WfXQx29bUF">s&box documentation website</a></p>

    <h3>Implementing the Vertex Shader</h3>
    <p>
        Okay, at first of all, create a new block like with previous sections: add <string>VS</string> and then add brackets on the next line. Inside this block,
        we need to include another core file, which is <string>common/vertex.hlsl</string>. Your section currently should look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
VS
{
    #include "common/vertex.hlsl"

    // ...
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Next step is adding the <b>main function</b> of a vertex shader. Main function in vertex shader is called <string>MainVs( input )</string>,
        where <string>input</string> is a vertex input struct you have just defined. In your case, it's <string>VertexInput</string>. Vertex shader must 
        return a finalized vertex with a type of <string>PixelInput</string> that will be used by a fragment shader. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
VS
{
    #include "common/vertex.hlsl"

    // "MainVs" is the name of a main vertex shader function. It always must be MainVs.
    // VertexInput is the "unprocessed" vertex data that we're feeding into vertex shader. It is our input. 
    // PixelInput is a type that vertex shader will return. Object of this type will be sent to fragment shader.
    PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
    {
        // ...
    }
}       
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Inside the brackets we can start doing all sorts of magic with the given vertex. Lets keep it minimal: process and finalize the vertex 
        using helper functions, and then return it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Declare a new variable with <string>PixelInput</string> type that is initialized by <string>ProcessVertex( i )</string>.
        Give it any name - it doesn't matter how is it called. Most shaders keep the name very minimal, something like <string>o</string>.
    </p>
    <p>
        And now, since we don't plan editing anything in this vertex data, just return <string>FinalizeVertex( o )</string>. Your vertex shader 
        is now ready! It will return a <string>PixelInput</string> object that you will utilize in fragment shader.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
        VS
        {
            #include "common/vertex.hlsl"
        
            // "MainVs" is the name of a main vertex shader function. It always must be MainVs.
            // VertexInput is the "unprocessed" vertex data that we're feeding into vertex shader. It is our input. 
            // PixelInput is a type that vertex shader will return. Object of this type will be sent to fragment shader.
            PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i )
            {
                // Create PixelInput object, initialize it with our processed vertex.
                // Between ProcessVertex() and FinalizeVertex() you can do any sorts of tricks
                // with your vertices.
                PixelInput o = ProcessVertex( i );

                // Return finalized vertex
                return FinalizeVertex( o );
            }
        }     
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Pixel Shader</h2>
    <p>
        This is a final stage of your shader. This is where we are going to manipulate the color and return it. For now, let's do a simple task: 
        set up a simple, solid color and return it. This will make appear whole material with a certain color, unlit. 
    </p>
    <h3>Adding the main function</h3>
    <p>
        Just like with vertex shader, create a new section. Give it a name <string>PS</string> and then add brackes.
        Inside the brackets, include another file - <string>common/pixel.hlsl</string>. It will import anything that fragment shader 
        needs for rendering and compiling correctly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After the include, create the main function of a fragment shader, <string>float4 MainPs( PixelInput i )</string>. 
        <string>float4</string> is a type that fragment shader returns, it must be exactly this type for now. <string>PixelInput</string>
        is the type that fragment shader receives from vertex shader. After typing this line, add <string>: SV_Target0</string> at the end. 
        It is a semantic that indicates that fragment shader returns a color. You probably won't ever need to touch this bit, just keep it as is. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we're doing a simple unlit shader, we're not utilizing anything from <string>PixelInput</string> data yet, but you will heavily
        utilize it in future articles when we move from unlit shader to a full, proper lit shader. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PS
{
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
    {
        // ...
    }
}        
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Quick note: "float" components</h3>
    <p>
        You're probably wondering, <b>what the hell is a float4?</b> If you know how <string>Vector4</string> (or <string>Vector3</string>) works,
        then you can guess how floats work! Number after the <string>float</string> indicates how many components is in this vector. You can have
        floats types from <string>float</string> (single component vector) to <string>float4</string> (four component vector).
    </p>
    <p>
        Each component of a float vector can be accessed with suffixes <string>.x</string>, <string>.y</string>, <string>.z</string> and <string>.w</string>.
        Alternatively, you can access them with <string>.r</string>, <string>.g</string>, <string>.b</string> and <string>.a</string>, so <string>.xyzw</string>
        is an equivalent of <string>.rgba</string>. It doesn't matter which variant you are using, it's fine to use either. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <string>float4</string> is often used to represent the color. As you may have probably guessed, RGBA is <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b> and <b>Alpha</b>
        (aka transparency). This is why we are returning <string>float4</string>, because fragment shader needs to return the opacity too, even if it's not used by our 
        shader yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using suffixes, you can access one or several channels of a <string>float</string> vector at once, swizzle them or extract into a new variable with less components.
        <string>int</string> and <string>uint</string> can consists of multiple components too, just like floats. I'll provide some more information on floats, how to use suffixes
        and some other cool stuff in the next article where we'll add a texture to our unlit shader.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding color and returning it</h3>
    <p>
        This is very simple. This code can be much more compact, but just for the sake of learning we'll do it in a bit longer way. Create a new <string>float3</string>
        variable, give it any name you like. For now, lets stick with "col". Initialize it by creating a new <string>float3</string> with values set to <string>1, 0, 0</string>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your like should look like this: <string>float3 col = float3( 1, 0, 0 );</string>
    </p>
    <p>
        What does <string>float3( 1, 0, 0 )</string> do? We just created a new three-component float with red (or X) channel set as <string>1</string>, while others are <string>0</string>.
        This will represent a pure red color. If you add <string>0.5</string> to green channel, then you'll get an orange color. If you add <string>1</string> to blue channel, 
        you'll get a bright pink color. If you make them all have value <b>1</b>, then you'll get white color. Have you ever seen the color picker window in Photoshop, with R, G, B input fields ranging from 0 to 255? It's the same here,
        except it's in 0-1 range!
    </p>
    <info>
        Most values in shaders are represented within <b>[0 - 1]</b> range. Going beyond this range may cause visual mess. You can use <string>saturate( float in )</string> to clamp
        your valie in 0-1 range if you expect that it'll be larger than that in realtime. Not sure if it is a good advice, but you probably want to write your math 
        in a way where you don't have to rely on <string>saturate()</string> too much.
        <br><br>
        There's an exception with normals - they are operating in <b>[-1 - 1]</b> range. 
    </info>
    <p>
        Then we just have to return the color, but inside a <string>float4</string> vector. Since our color just represents <b>RGB</b> without <b>A</b> component (opacity),
        shader won't compile because expected type is <b>float4</b>. Do <string>float4( col, 1 )</string>, and return it.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="highlight-hlsl">
PS
{
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
    {
        float3 col = float3( 1, 0, 0 );
        float4 FinalColor = float4( col, 1 );

        return FinalColor;
    }
}            
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Combining or splitting floats is very easy, as you can see. You can initialize float4 by filling out all four values, or just add existing multi-component 
        float and then fill out the value for missing component, like we did above. <string>float3 col</string> has RGB components already, and we're only missing 
        component <string>A</string>, so we just created a new float4 with RGB components filled out by values from our variable <string>col</string>, and then 
        added <string>1</string> for alpha component. 1 in alpha component will be usually interpreted as "fully opaque".
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this article ends, lets simplify our code a little:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
PS
{
    #include "common/pixel.hlsl"

    float4 MainPs( PixelInput i ) : SV_Target0
    {
        return float4( float3( 1, 0, 0 ), 1 );
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Yeah! Instead of creating variables for each value seperately, we can just do this instead. Create a <string>float4 vector</string>, where we create a new
        <string>float3</string> with pure red color, which automatically fills out RGB values, and then set float4's alpha component to 1, and then instantly return it. You can do it this way. But this is your code,
        and I trust that you know better what's more convenient for you. :-)
    </p>

    <img src="/media/pt2_shaderresult.png">
    <p>
        And here you go, you've got your first manually written unlit shader. Ignore these two random texture inputs: we'll get rid of them and add our own 
        in the next article. Also, do you see all stuff on the left, like "rendering" and such? These are all the features included from our 
        <string>#import "common/features.hlsl"</string> in <string>FEATURES</string> block, which means it worked!

    <h3>EXTRA: My compiler is failing!</h3>
    <p>
        That's fine! You will probably deal with this a lot. All shader compiler logs are stored in your console. If something is failing to compile, 
        it will dump all relevant information, and point to potential cause of the problem. It is also pretty good at catching typos and other 
        basic mistakes.
