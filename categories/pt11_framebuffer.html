        Frame buffers are very useful in cases when applying opacity to your model isn't helpful. In this article, I'll tell about 
        their purpose, use-cases and show a few examples what can you do with them. And if we're speaking about post-processing shaders, 
        frame buffers absolutely necessary in almost all situations. 
    </p>

    <h2>Implementing Frame Buffer</h2>
    <p>
        Frame buffer represents the current frame. This is what is being displayed on your screen. Just like any other texture, 
        current frame is represented as a Texture2D objects in shaders. Frame buffer isn't accessible by default, there are a few 
        things you have to do before being able to read them.  
    </p>

    <warning>
        Sometimes frame buffer may not render after applying all appropriate changes to the shader code. This may fix itself 
        after a few seconds, but usually restarting the editor is the most reliable solution. 
    </warning>
    <h3>Attributes Setup</h3>
    <p>
        To properly fetch frame buffer, you have to add two <string>BoolAttribute</string> properties, and create a new Texture2D 
        for the frame buffer itself. This must be placed in pixel shader, <b>outside</b> of <string>MainPs</string>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
BoolAttribute(bWantsFBCopyTexture, true);
BoolAttribute(translucent, true);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <b>bWantsFBCopyTexture</b> will indicate that this shader requires a frame buffer. <b>translucent</b> indicates that this 
        shader must be transparent: we're not changing actual transparency here, but it will make sure that materials with this
        shader won't show up on the frame texture, since objects with transparency aren't written to it. We must do it because 
        otherwise your mesh will render itself in frame buffer, essentially making it appear as a regular opaque surfac, which is useless.
    </p>
    <p>
        And add the Texture2D for the frame buffer. Make sure to give it an attribute with the name of <b>FrameBufferCopyTexture</b>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Texture2D g_tFrameBufferCopyTexture < Attribute("FrameBufferCopyTexture"); SrgbRead( false ); >;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        It can be sampled now. Let's go into the <string>MainPs</string> section now.
    </p>

    <h3>Viewport UV and Frame Sampling</h3>
    <p>
        Frame buffer can be sampled the same way as any other texture, although with different type of coordinates. You're probably 
        thinking that screen-space coordinates would work here, but they're not correct for frame buffer - they must be viewport-corrected first, using 
        the helper function <string>CalculateViewportUv()</string>. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 ViewportUv = CalculateViewportUv( i.vPositionSs.xy );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now, using corrected UVs, you can sample the frame buffer:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float3 frame = g_tFrameBufferCopyTexture.Sample( g_sAniso, ViewportUv ).rgb;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        If you want to see if buffer is displaying correctly, you can return the pixel early just with the buffer image:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
return float4( frame, 1 );
    </code></pre>

    <img src="/media/framebuffer.png">
    <p>
        As you can see, frame buffer is working correctly because one of the voxel dudes, despite standing behind these objects, 
        appears visible. Since this tree and floor are marked as translucent, they're not being rendered in the frame texture. This 
        means that frame buffer is being rendered on top of the mesh surface correctly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another reminder that sometimes frame buffer may appear as a missing texture. If you're sure you didn't miss out 
        important attributes, then you probably just have to restart the editor. 
    </p>

    <h3>Frame Offset Problem</h3>
    <p>
        You may ran into a situation where going into play mode from editor may screw up the materials that use frame buffer. 
        It looks like this: 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt11_fuckedfb.png">
    <p>
        While I'm not entirely sure what's causing this problem, but you may often run into these issues while going between 
        play/editor modes, and when material editor is open. This may be a problem with the way I'm implementing the frame buffer.
        But anyway, don't worry about it - this issue doesn't show up in the game itself, and will affect you only in editor. 
    </p>

    <h3>Frame Buffer Downsides</h3>
    <p>
        Using frame buffer has it's own set of limitations, this isn't a "superior" way to handle transparency on objects. 
        It is just one of the options you can use for handling transparency in your shader. It's probably not 
        significantly cheaper either. Use it only if you specifically need it, like in cases where you need to somehow 
        iterate pixels that are rendering behind the translucent surface. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Trying to render multiple surfaces with frame buffer that overlap with each probably won't work. Other transparent 
        materials will not render in frame buffer. While opacity has alpha test that allows properly rendering overlapping meshes 
        (including with backfaces), there's no similar solution for frame buffer. If you need surface transparency for these 
        purposes, stick with proper opacity instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Example: Advanced Glass</h2>
    <p>
        Using frame buffer just as a plain replacement for transparency would be redundant, so why not try doing some special 
        effects with it? 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the article <article-ref link="pt7_opacity">Opacity and Alpha Test</article-ref> I have shown a basic glass material 
        example that utilizes opacity and alpha-testing. Now, let's use frame buffer instead, and take the advantages of rendering 
        surface transparency this way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll need to have a texture set ready for this section. If you don't have any appropriate textures, here's a material 
        that I've used as an example for this tutorial: 
    </p>

    <h3>Applying via Opacity Map</h3>
    <p>
        First, let's make it so frame buffer appears only in intended transparent areas, so it works like an actual transparent material 
        where opacity map controls the visuals.  
    </p>
    <info>
        This example will use a base PBR shader. You can read more about implementing a custom PBR shader in 
        <article-ref link="pt6_lighting">Lighting and Shading Model</article-ref> article. A very basic shader that 
        outputs material to a standard shading model will be sufficient for this example. 
    </info>
    <p>
        If you don't have opacity map implemented as a texture input in your shader, add this: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
CreateInputTexture2D( Opacity, Linear, 8, "", "_alpha", "Material A,10/Opacity,10/70", Default( 1 ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        If you're using PBR shader example from the article mentioned above, you probably should have a normal map texture 
        that has unused alpha channel. If that's the case, you can store the opacity there: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
Texture2D NormalMap < Channel( RGB, Box( Normal ), Linear ); Channel( A, Box( Opacity ), Linear ); OutputFormat( DXT5 ); SrgbRead( false ); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        In shader code, just sample <string>NormalMap</string> as <b>float4</b> and then decode normal map from .rgb component 
        separately. Leave alpha component as is, it'll be used later.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float4 NormalOpacity = NormalMap.Sample( g_sAniso, uv ).rgba; 
float3 normal = DecodeNormal( NormalOpacity.rgb );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Sample the frame texture. Don't forget to get proper viewport UVs as sampling coordinates, or else this frame will be 
        messed up.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float2 ViewportUv = CalculateViewportUv( i.vPositionSs.xy );
float3 frame = g_tFrameBufferCopyTexture.Sample( g_sAniso, ViewportUv ).rgb;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Frame buffer needs to be applied onto a texture. I think adding it to <b>Emission</b> slot in material's object works best: 
        texture becomes unaffected by lighting conditions but still has all shading features like reflections by roughness/
        metalness properties. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how you add it: add frame texture variable, and then multiply it by the inverted opacity map. It will make all 
        opaque bits of the material dark on the emission map, which means it will make frame buffer invisible there. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
// (1.0 - NormalOpacity.a) inverts NormalOpacity.a 
Material mat = Material::Init();
// ...
mat.Emission = frame.rgb * (1.0 - NormalOpacity.a);
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Surface Distortion</h3>
    <p>
        You know how some bumpy mirror/window surfaces can distort objects behind of it? Let's implement this effect, this should 
        be fairly easy. For this effect, you'll need to use tangent-space normals. 
    </p>
    <info>
        <p>
            ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Reminder! Tangent-space normals is what you get after decoding the normal map texture using <string>DecodeNormal</string>
            function. There are also world-space normals, which is what you must insert into the material properties before passing it 
            into shading model.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read more about normals, their orientation types and formats in <article-ref link="normals">Normal Map Types</article-ref>
            that covers almost all basic information.
        </p>
    </info>
    <p>
        By default, values from your normal map may be too "small" to be effective for distorting the UV. So let's make a 
        new variable that allows adjusting the distortion intensity:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float g_flDistortionIntensity < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 8 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup("Material A,10/Normal Map,10/32"); >; 
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Let's update the viewport UV now. We can do very basic distortion effect by offsetting UV using values from 
        red and green channels of tangent-space normals, which represent X and Y axis. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float flDistortion = normal.rg * (g_flDistortionIntensity * 8);
float2 ViewportUv = CalculateViewportUv( i.vPositionSs.xy - flDistortion );     
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string>i.vPositionSs.xy - flDistortion</string> will offset the UV by given value from normal map's RG component,
                after intensity correction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>normal.rg * (g_flDistortionIntensity * 8)</string> will adjust the intensity of given normal map.
                It gets a bit weird in order to compensate how small values in normal maps can be.
                You're free to edit this part as you wish. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now compile these changes, adjust the values in material editor, and see what happens!

    <h3>Screenspace Fog Effect</h3>
    <p>
        This doesn't have much practical use, but if you want to add fog just inside of your frame buffer, that's still possible. 
        Using linear depth buffer values, you can paint fog onto the frame buffer, which means that while main texture remains 
        unaffected, everything on frame texture will be with a fog!
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's add variables for the fog. You'll need fog color, fog density, and end distance point in world-space units. 
        Linear depth values allow definining "end" position for the depth buffer in world-space units, which is very useful.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float g_flFogEndDistanceWs < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 1024 ); Default( 512 ); UiGroup("Material A,10/Layer Settings,10/20"); >;
float g_flFogDensity < UiType( Slider ); Range( 0, 1 ); Default( 1 ); UiGroup("Material A,10/Layer Settings,10/21"); >;
float3 g_vFrameBufferFogColor < UiType( Color ); Default3( 1, 0, 0.5 ); UiGroup("Material A,10/Layer Settings,10/22"); >;
    </code></pre>
    <info>
        I've tried simplifying the name to <string>g_vFogColor</string> and turns out that variable with this name is already 
        defined in <string>common.fxc</string> and <string>hlsl.hlsl</string> (what)
    </info>
    <p>
        Go to <string>MainPs</string> again, get the linear depth buffer value using <string>Depth::GetLinear()</string>. 
        It takes screen-space coordinates as UV input, you don't have to correct them for viewport. Don't forget to offset them 
        by <string>flDistortion</string> so it stays in-line with frame buffer UVs.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
float flLinear = Depth::GetLinear( i.vPositionSs.xy - flDistortion );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now blend frame buffer texture (before passing it to emission slot) with the fog color, and use depth buffer value for interpolation:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-hlsl">
frame = lerp( g_vFrameBufferFogColor, frame, smoothstep( 0, g_flFogDensity, 1 - flLinear / g_flFogEndDistanceWs ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Let me clarify some bits here:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <string> smoothstep( 0, g_flFogDensity, ... )</string> allows remapping the depth values so final fog gradient 
                can be adjusted to be shorter/longer, defined by <b>g_flFogDensity</b> variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <string>1 - flLinear / g_flFogEndDistanceWs</string> inverts <b>flLinear</b> and then divides by distance value. 
                So if you set end distance to <b>500</b>, then this fog will become 100% visible at 500 world-space units away 
                from the camera. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can now go to material editor and adjust the fog.
    </p>
    <img src="/media/pt11_fbfog.png">
    <p>
        Don't forget that this section is just an example, if you're going to implement these effects please do it properly. 
        Wrap optional features into combos or separate shaders, don't waste computing time on things that most artists would 
        probably want to keep disabled by default. 
    </p>

    <h2>Post-processing Frame Buffer</h2>
    <p>
        I highly recommend reading the <article-ref link="postprocessing_basics">Basic Postprocessing</article-ref> article 
        since it goes in much better details about post-processing implementation and other stuff. However, I'll just mentioned 
        that unlike regular surface shaders, post-processing have a different way of fetching the frame texture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, frame buffer is usually passed directly into the shader from a custom C# component, created just for the 
        post-processing effect. This is how it's done in the component:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
RenderAttributes attributes = new();
// ...
Graphics.GrabFrameTexture( "ColorBuffer", attributes );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <b>ColorBuffer</b> is the attribute name for Texture2D inside of your post-processing shader. RenderAttributes object 
        holds all the variables and other data that you want to pass into the shader. 
    </p>
