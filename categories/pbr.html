    <warning>
        This article is unfinished and I am not sure if I want to commit to it, something tells me that this bit 
        is redundant for this place. It's one of those things I think would be easier to look up online rather than reading 
        about it here. 
    </warning>
    <p>
        s&box comes with a standard Source 2 shading model, which utilizes <b>PBR</b> for shading and lighting, also known as 
        <b>Physically Based Rendering</b>. This is a modern technique used by pretty much all modern engines these days, and s&box 
        is not an exception. (at least if you're using the standard shading model)
    </p>
    <p>
        Every texture describe some specific surface properties that helps rendering fancy looking visuals. Roughness defines how shiny your 
        surface is, metalness affects reflectivity, and ambient occlusion allows using baked "shaded" areas to add nicer depth for the texture 
        without having to do any extra shading. There is also a normal map existing for easy and cheap detail shading, but this technique exists 
        in many other rendering techniques too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though you can create your own shading models, nearly all s&box shaders these days rely on PBR. I won't get too nerdy about how does it work,
        but it may be useful to understand how do they work if there's more "programmer" than "artist" in your mind. Generally, every PBR
        material consists of specific set of textures.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Albedo Map</h3>
    <p>
        Also known as a color map. It is a RGB texture, which means in HLSL code it is usually represented as <string>float3</string>. 
        This is a base color of your material, it has no effect on shading. Albedo maps are always read in sRGB mode in shaders, this is important!
        If you try reading the texture in linear color space, your colors will probably appear inaccurate. 
    </p>

    <h3>Normal Map</h3>
    <p>
        Normal map is a good old technique that allows rendering little surface details at a low rendering cost. Normal maps are also using 
        RGB channels, so it is also represented by <string>float3</string> vector. Most game engines, including s&box, expect that your normal 
        map is in <b>OpenGL</b> (Y up) format, with normals oriented in tangent space. 
    </p>

    <h3>Roughness Map</h3>
    <p>
        Roughness map is a grayscale texture that defines how shiny your surface is, so it's a <string>float</string> component in HLSL.
        Higher value means that your surface is very rough and barely produces any shine, while lower values indicate that material surface is smooth. There is a very good website called 
        <a href="https://physicallybased.info/">"Physically Based"</a> which has physically accurate surface properties for lots of materials.
    </p>

    <h3>Metalness Map</h3>
    <p>
        Metalness map is also grayscale texture that described the reflectivity of given surface. 0 means that this object is non-metallic, 
        while higher values make it appear metallic with more reflectivity. Setting up this surface is important to make metallic surfaces
        in PBR appear correctly. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ambient Occlusion</h3>
    <p>
        Ambient Occlusion is a grayscale texture that allows adding cheap shading details for the surface. Usually these shadows are baked 
        by the texturing software of your choice. It adds very subtle shading details that are visible only in those spots of the surface 
        that are currently covered by a shadow, giving it a nice realistic effect.     
    </p>

    <p>
        Roughness, metalness and ambient occlusion maps are often packed and compiled into a single RGB texture inside the shader, since it 
        minimizes amount of generated texture files for each material and allows sampling all 3 of them once. 
    </p>

    <h2>Creating textures</h2>
    <p>
        Textures these days are created in software like <b>Substance Painter</b> or <b>Marmoset Toolbag</b> (if you're texturing props), 
        or <b>Substance Designer</b> if you're making generic textures for world environment or other purposes. All of them prioritize PBR 
        as the main way of shading, too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All of them have many things set up to make creating PBR textures as quick as possible, so you don't have to worry about setting up 
        each map individually. The only exception is Substance Designer, where you're expected to have full control over every detail. They also 
        all come with nice preview renderers so you can know how does your material looks like. These visuals will be pretty close to what
        you'll see in s&box.
