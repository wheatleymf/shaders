# Shader Things
This is an extremely early iteration of various shader things for beginners. It is focused on content for s&box specifically, and should help beginners to go over the basics and gradually start implementing more complex things as they learn more about HLSL, syntax, s&box API, scalar values and vectors, and bunch of other stuff.

This repository is probably temporary, and I am not sure if I want to host it on the current domain (shaders.wheatleymf.net) - so please don't get surprised if it suddenly disappears, or moves to other domain. All material in it is WIP, there *will* be errors. 

# Contributing
Although this isn't final version and there are still plenty of changes planned ahead, I am still happy for the feedback and contributions: if you have any cool stuff to share, or you want to change something about any existing content, feel free to make a pull request or contact me. All contributors will be credited.
