# Shader Things
### [https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/](https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/)
This is an extremely early iteration of various shader things for beginners. It is focused on content for s&box specifically, and should help beginners to go over the basics and gradually start implementing more complex things as they learn more about HLSL, syntax, s&box API, scalar values and vectors, and bunch of other stuff. This is noob stuff, by noob for noobs.

I'm also happy to accept any articles by the community, if you're okay with abysmally dogshit backend and how pages are set up, and you can make something your own with it, please feel free to submit a pull request, too.
