# Shader Things
### [https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/](https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/)
This is an extremely early iteration of various shader things for beginners. It is focused on content for s&box specifically, and should help beginners to go over the basics and gradually start implementing more complex things as they learn more about HLSL, syntax, s&box API, scalar values and vectors, and bunch of other stuff. This is noob stuff, by noob for noobs. 

You probably shouldn't use this as an entry point if you're very invested into graphics programming, but I imagine this will be helpful for tech artists that want to make their stuff look cooler than ever. 

## Contributing
I'll be glad to accept any fixes, improvements, clarifications and new articles/courses as pull requests. You will be properly credited. Backend is quite a mess at the moment, hopefully it will get better in the future. 

HTML pages use some custom tags to make some special content like download buttons and article headers much easier to maintain: see ["Contributing"](https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/?entry=contributing) for all details. 

## Issues
- **Acknowledged:**
- - Pages may look off/broken. Website is still going through bunch of significant styling and layout changes, so this can break pages if you have old version cached. `Ctrl`+`F5` should reset the cache. 
- **Pending:**
- - This website layout will not work from phones at all. It will be horrible. Sometime in the future I will focus on making the layout significantly more mobile-friendly.
- - There's no material about compute and geometry shaders at the moment.
- - Page loading could be improved, you may see icon names before they're properly loaded on page.
- - Backend still needs a lot of work and better automation, especially index navigation.
