# Shader Things
### [https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/](https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/)
Open-source website with a collection of beginner friendly tutorials on basic shader things: surface shaders, post-processing shaders, various base HLSL references, and even more coming in the future. It is focused on content for s&box specifically, and should help beginners to go over the basics and gradually start implementing more complex things as they learn more about HLSL, syntax, s&box API, scalar values and vectors, and bunch of other stuff. This is noob stuff, by noob for noobs. 

You probably shouldn't use this as an entry point if you're very invested into graphics programming, but I imagine this will be helpful for tech artists that want to make their stuff look cooler than ever. 

## Contributing
I'll be glad to accept any fixes, improvements, clarifications and new articles/courses as pull requests. You will be properly credited. Backend is quite a mess at the moment, hopefully it will get better in the future. 

Articles are simple HTML pages stored in `/categories` folder. To render some special content without having to copy and paste HTML snippets everywhere, things like article headers, download sections and various styling things are using custom HTML tags. See ["Contributing"](https://shaders.wheatleymf.net/?entry=contributing) for all details about writing articles. 

## Issues
- **Acknowledged:**
- - Pages may look off/broken after updates. If you had visited this page before, there's a good chance you have CSS stylings cached in your browser. Clear your browser cache.  
- **Pending:**
- - There's no information about compute and geometry shaders at the moment.
- - There's no automation on backend, this isn't high priority but if this get website gets some contributors support, I'm open to help improving content management.
